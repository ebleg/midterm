\chapter{Economic engineering with analytical mechanics}
\label{chap:ee}
Economic engineering is built on analogies between (macro)economic theory and common engineering disciplines such as thermodynamics, circuit theory, and (classical) mechanics\footnote{as opposed to more recent theories in relativistic mechanics and quantum mechanics}. Especially for the latter, a rich variety of useful analogs can be devised. There are two common classes of interpretations mechanics: \emph{analytical mechanics} including the formulations by Joseph-Louis Lagrange and Sir William Rowan Hamilton, and \emph{vectorial mechanics}, better known as \emph{Newtonian mechanics}. The former variant is usually preferred in the field of engineering whereas the analytical mechanics are more common in physics due to their mathematical elegance and powerful theoretical foundation. Likewise, the theory of economic engineering can be approached in two similar ways. Usually, the `Newtonian' approach is given the most attention, but in the case of this work, the energy-based approach will prove to be more useful, which is why it is the subject of this discussion. This discussion will mostly pertain to `regular' economic systems, but it is the underlying aspiration of this research that these formal methods will allow establishing a sound framework for financial systems as well.

Analytical mechanics, more specifically \emph{Lagrangian} and \emph{Hamiltonian} mechanics, are established around the definition of special state functions, respectively called the Lagrangian \(\lag\) and the Hamiltonian \(\ham\). As per usual, Lagrangian mechanics will be introduced first, for it has the most intuitive explanation. Then, a more formal approach allows (Legendre) transform the discussion into one of Hamiltonian mechanics. 

In this chapter, frequent analogies will be made between mechanics and economics; as such, the idea is to have the `normal text' pertain mostly to the discussion of classical mechanics, and to provide the analogies in special `boxes' like so:
\begin{econ}{Example}
    An analogy between economics and classical mechanics.
\end{econ}
The reason for this particular choice of layout is twofold: first, it allows to make a sharp distinction between the older, extremely rigorous theory of classical mechanics and the novel approach of economic engineering: many ideas and propositions are still tentative (especially in the realm of classical mechanics) as the field of economic engineering matures. Secondly, it allows for easier reference as to not obscure the economic analogies (which are arguably the most important aspects of this chapter) with the highly theoretical discussion of analytical mechanics.
\section{Economic engineering}
The discipline of `economic engineering' is a very new one. The theoretical foundations have been developed over the past years at the Delft Center of Systems and Control primarily by prof. em. dr. ir. Mendel, combined with the contributions of several theses that have been recently written about the subject. The purpose of economic engineering is to use tools from various engineering disciplines and physics to improve the predictive power of (macro)economic models. The core idea is to extend `domain neutral modeling techniques such as bond graph modeling \cite{Karnopp2012} that are built on analogiesween mechanical, electrical,,,,, hydraulic, ... systems to economic systems as well. Hence, one attempts to give an economic interpretation to a generalized mass (I-element), generalized spring (C-element) and generalized damper (R-element). The idea is that this consistent engineering approach leads to actual \emph{predictive} models that provide much richer insights than the `stylized facts' from macroeconomy or, on the other end of the spectrum, the `black-box' econometric models that have lost all interpretative value. Indeed, applied economic engineering pursues \emph{gray-box} modeling instead, as is most common in traditional engineering models \cite{Kruimer2021}. Some analogies between mechanical, electrical and economic systems are listed in \cref{tab:analogies} to merely for the sake of illustration; a thorough motivation for each of them will be given in the following section. \Cref{tab:analogies} provides some examples of the analogies that are used within economic engineering. In general, their meaning is not as specific as given here and this table applies only to the most elementary cases.

The main theory behind economic engineering is outlined by \citet{Mendel2019}. Some other notable results in the field have been achieved in recent years as well. \citet{Hutters2020b} demonstrated the application of Hamiltonian mechanics to dissipative systems as to include the mechanics of consumption in port-Hamiltonian systems. A formal approach inspired by the theory of thermodynamics was used by \citet{Manders2019} to explain economic growth and productivity. \citet{Kruimer2021} and \citet{VanArdenne2020} used economic engineering bond graph techniques to build extensive models for the U.S. economy and a `generalized' firm (as to improve business valuation techniques).

\section{Lagrangian mechanics}
\subsection{The configuration manifold}
Central to the concept of Lagrangian mechanics is the so-called \emph{configuration space} \(M\), which is an \(n\)-dimensional manifold provided with some parameterization called \emph{generalized coordinates} assembled in the vector \(\gpos\). 
The configuration manifold may just be equal to \(\real^n\), but in more interesting and realistic cases it is often some manifold embedded in \(\real^n\). This is often the result of holonomic constraints, which are constraints that impose a restriction only on the configuration space, but not, for example, on the allowable velocities.
By using the generalized coordinates, one can parameterize all the allowable positions of a system whose motions may occur in a higher-dimensional space with a smaller coordinate set (e.g. the two-dimensional motion of a pendulum can be expressed in a single coordinate due to the constraint imposed by the rigid link).  The crucial insight here is that the constraint forces will never perform any work on the system\footnote{This is known as \emph{D'Alembert's principle}.}; as such, they act always orthogonally to the configuration manifold. This is why, provided that one is successful in correctly describing this manifold with a suitable coordinate set, the constraint forces need not be taken into account: a  major advantage over Newtonian mechanics.

Unfortunately, the pursuit of finding a set of these all-encompassing generalized coordinates is fruitless for some systems, for they cannot possibly be represented in this simple fashion. Luckily, for a certain class of constraints, they may be included to constrict the motion of the system nevertheless by means of the \emph{Lagrange multipliers}. They are applicable to holonomic constraints for which it is impractical or non-intuitive to take them into account directly in the parameterization of the configuration manifold, and a restricted class of nonholonomic constraints that can be written in the so-called \emph{Pfaffian} form \cite{Bullo2005}.

    \label{fig:conf_mnfold}
\end{figure}

\begin{econ}{The configuration manifold and the economic system}
    In economic engineering, \(\gpos\) has a similar intuitive notion, namely the stock values of various products, which denote the `position' of some economic system. The name `position' may be misleading when intuitively ported to the familiar three-dimensional space; the configuration space usually has less structure such as the absence of a metric or inner product.\\

    Just like in mechanics, the simplest shape the configuration manifold $M$ can take is a simple $n$-dimensional vector space, but more sophisticated cases exist as well. As mentioned, a nontrivial configuration manifold is usually the result of holonomic constraints applied to the system; these constraints have their meaning in economics too.
    For example, when Lagrangian analysis is applied to the analysis of electrical circuits, the generalized coordinates naturally reflect Kirchoff's current laws (what comes in must go out); as they provide simple constraints to the current in each part of the circuit. An intuitive extension can be made to economics, where the flow of goods is often subject to a Kirchoff-type law as well, especially when considering supply chains or transport. \\
    
    A simple example in economic engineering might be a market with a supplier, a trader, and a demander, each with their own storage. Because the total amount of product is limited by the endowment of the system (the so-called Edgeworth Box), a constraint is imposed on the allowable configurations of the system.
\end{econ}

\subsection{Hamilton's principle of stationary action}
The configuration manifold is described in the previous section is the first step in the Lagrangian approach, for it defines a single mathematical space containing all the possible motions of the system. For all intents and purposes, it usually pertains to the very nature of the system itself; e.g. the wiring of the electrical circuit, how the mechanical parts are connected to each other or which goods are present in an economic system, and whether their quantities are fundamentally related. Of course, the configuration manifold itself does not provide any information about the behavior of the system: this is where Hamilton's principle comes in --- the second, crucial puzzle piece that makes Lagrangian mechanics work.

Hamilton's principle (also referred to as the principle of least or stationary action) concerns the existence of a special state function, the Lagrangian $\lag$, determines the system's behavior \cite{Arnold1989}:
\begin{thmblock}{Hamilton's principle}
    Motions $\gamma: \real \to M$ of a mechanical system coincide with extremals of the action functional
    \begin{equation}
        S(\gamma) = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \lag \dd{t},
        \label{eq:ham_principle}
    \end{equation}
    where $\lag$ is the \emph{Lagrangian function} of the system.
\end{thmblock}
The Lagrangian \(\lag\) is a mapping from the \emph{tangent bundle} \(TM\) of the configuration manifold \(M\), optionally paired with a time argument for time-varying problems to the reals,
    \[ \lag : TM \times \real^+ \to \real, \]
i.e. it takes a generalized position \(\gpos\) and a generalized velocity \(\gvel\) (which live in the tangent space of \(M\)), and a time instance to some scalar values.
\index{Hamilton's principle}
\index{generalized velocities}
\index{principle of least action}
\index{tangent space}
\index{tangent bundle}

The aforementioned principle only is for now only helpful on a conceptual level, because it does not how to arrive at any solutions. For this, a branch of mathematics called the calculus of variations comes to aid, which is concerned with finding extremals of \emph{functionals}\footnote{A functional is a real-valued function on a vector space (of functions.)}, in this case, \(S\). A necessary condition for \(S\) to attain an extremum is that 
\[ \var{S} = 0,\]
where \(\var{S}\) is called the \emph{first variation} of \(S\). Just like a regular differential can be seen as an infinitesimal perturbation of a function value, the variation is a very small perturbation of a functional by means of a trajectory \(h(t)\). The resulting perturbed functional can then in general be decomposed in a part that varies linearly with \(h\), and a nonlinear part. The requirement for the extremal is that the \emph{linear part vanishes for any} \(h\) \cite{Arnold1989}.
\index{functional}

\citet{Landau1960} use the the tools of the calculus of variations to show that the solution of \cref{eq:ham_principle} is
\[ \dv{}{t}\qty(\pdv{\lag}{\gvel}) - \pdv{\lag}{\gpos} = 0. \]
This yields a total of \(n\) second-order differential equations, or equivalently a system of \(2n\) first-order equations. A special significance is assigned to the vector $\pdv{\lag}{\gvel}$, defined as the \emph{generalized momentum} $\gmom$.
\index{generalized momentum}

\begin{econ}{Hamilton's principle and utility maximization}
    The generalization of Hamilton's principle to economics is not far-fetched; it is generally accepted that elementary economic agents act to maximize their own utility; this is known as the \emph{utility maximization problem}\footnote{It is important to realize that the term `extremal' does not necessarily refer to a minimum, as is often incorrectly stated when explaining Hamilton's theorem --- indeed, the least action principle is sometimes called the principle of \emph{stationary} action, which is more in line with its mathematical definition.}. \\
    \index{utility maximization principle}

    Thus, the formulation of economic motions as an extremal problem is quite straightforward. However, in order to descend from a purely philosophical debate a formalism that is actually useful, the Lagrangian must be assigned with concrete meaning. As such, our aim is to translate the concept of energy to economics. In mechanics, the \emph{energy} of the system is, bluntly speaking, its ability to perform \emph{work}. For now, a purely mechanical interpretation is pursued, neglecting the connection between temperature and energy --- the application of economic engineering and thermodynamics is described in the thesis of \citet{Manders2019}. The economic engineering interpretation of work is the fulfilling of wants. As such, the energy of an economic system is its ability to fulfill wants. A natural dichotomy arises when viewing the economic system in terms of its configuration manifold and generalized `velocities' (product flows), akin to the of forms energy in mechanics.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \emph{Kinetic energy} is related to the utility due to market (trading) activity, it, therefore, depends in the first place on the \emph{flow of goods}; it is the surplus of the economic agent \cite{Mankiw2017}.
        \item \emph{Potential energy} gives significance to utility obtained from the possession of goods; it must therefore depend on stock levels. One can see this as a sort of `convenience yield' (a term used in futures pricing): the benefits of actually possessing the good.
    \end{itemize}
    A more rigorous definition of these concepts in economics will be given later in this section. The intuition behind the principle of stationary action can be found in \citet{Feynman2010}:
    \begin{quote}
        \emph{``[...] the solution is some kind of balance between trying to get more potential energy with the least amount of extra kinetic energy—trying to get the difference, kinetic minus the potential, as small as possible."}
    \end{quote}
    Likewise, this can be restated as the basic least action principle in economic engineering:
    \begin{quote}
        \textbf{Hamilton's principle in economic engineering}\\ Economic agents try  to maximize their convenience yield (the utility of the goods they possess) by sacrificing as little  economic surplus as possible
    \end{quote}
    As described by \citet{Feynman2010}, this is not only a global trajectory, but also a local one at every (infinitesimal) piece of the trajectory: one can see this as a formal restatement of the rational behavior of economic agents, which is a crucial assumption in may economic theories \cite{Mankiw2017}.
\end{econ}

\subsection{Kinetic energy}
In classical mechanics, the Lagrangian is defined by convention
\[\lag(\gpos,\gvel; t) = \ecokin(\gpos,\gvel; t) - \epot(\gpos; t),\] 
where \ecokin is the kinetic co-energy\footnote{As will become clear later, the term `co-energy' is used to distinguish between the definition of kinetic energy in terms of the generalized momenta, which is the perspective of Hamiltonian mechanics.} of the system and \epot the potential energy. If \(M\) is a Riemannian manifold and its Lagrangian has the aforementioned form, the system is called \emph{natural} \cite{Arnold1989}.

In the most general terms, the kinetic energy of the system is \emph{defined} as a quadratic form on the tangent space of the configuration manifold. Assuming that $m$ is a Riemannian manifold (i.e. it is equipped with a Riemannian metric $\inner{\vec{\xi}}{\vec{\xi}}$), one can define the kinetic co-energy as
\begin{equation}
    \ecokin = \frac{m}{2}\inner{\vec{v}}{\vec{v}}\qq{with } \vec{v} \in TM_{\vec{x}}.
    \label{eq:ekin_mfld}
\end{equation}
The usage of $\ecokin$ in the Lagrangian formulation is only useful if it is expressed in the generalized coordinates and generalized velocities; in general, $\ecokin$ will be of the form
\begin{equation}
    \ecokin(\gpos, \gvel) = \frac{1}{2}m_{ij}(\gpos)\dot{q}_i\dot{q_j},
    \label{eq:kinetic_energy}
\end{equation}
observing the Einstein summation convention. This interpretation of kinetic co-energy as a Riemannian metric on the configuration manifold must not be overlooked; indeed, a free particle (i.e. in the absence of potential forces) will follow a trajectory along the \emph{geodesic} dictated by the `kinetic co-energy metric'; this is called the Maupertuis-Jacobi principle \cite{Arnold1989}.

The distinction between energy and co-energy is not very common in literature, although thoroughly discussed by \citet{Jeltsema2009}. Energy is the ability to do work, while co-energy is the \emph{complement of energy}. Because energy is defined in terms of work, kinetic energy $\ekin$ should be defined in terms of momentum -- the integral of an applied force over time, instead of a velocity. The linear relation behind the change of variables from momentum to velocity by means of the mass makes the distinction between energy and co-energy moot at first glance, but it is nevertheless important to consider. The kinetic energy and co-energy are not always equal after all, e.g. in the relativistic case where the mass will depend on the velocity as well. In the simple non-relativistic case, for a single particle with mass $m$, the following relations hold:
$$ \text{kinetic energy } \ekin = \int \frac{p}{m}\dd{p} = \frac{p^2}{2m}\qquad
   \text{kinetic co-energy } \ecokin = \int m v \dd{v} = \frac{mv^2}{2}.$$

\begin{econ}{Kinetic energy and market surplus}
    The interpretation of kinetic energy in economic engineering is a big leap forward, perhaps one of the most fundamental aspects of the entire theoretical framework. However, the formulation in \cref{eq:ekin_mfld} obscures the intuition behind it. This is why it is more instructive to look at the simple scalar case, where kinetic energy is a notion of the amount of work it takes to accelerate a particle from rest to a certain velocity.

    To explain the significance of kinetic energy as surplus, the example given by \citet[chap.~6]{Marshall1920} about consumer's surplus will be recycled here in order to illustrate the point.

    Imagine a woman (Jane), who likes to drink tea. When buying tea, she continuously makes the unconscious deliberations between (i) how much she likes to drink tea and (ii) how much she likes to pay for tea --- this is a consequence of the assumption that Jane is a rational market participant. \citeauthor{Marshall1920} quantifies Jane's unconscious deliberation process by means of the following table:
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tabular}{lcccc}
            Price / pound & 20 & 14 & 10 & 6 \\
            \midrule
            Pounds bought / year & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\
        \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
    It is rather straightforward that Jane is willing to buy more tea as it gets cheaper and vice versa. Marshall explains this by means of the concept of utility: if the price of tea, say 20\$, drops to 14\$, Jane obtains her additional pound of tea for 14\$ for instead of the 20\$ she was willing to pay for the first pound. As such, she gains a surplus satisfaction (or consumer's surplus) of 6\$ --- this is, as Marshall states, \emph{precisely} the additional utility of the second pound of tea, i.e. how much Jane values it on top of the first one. The total utility of the two pounds of tea per year is then 20\$ +  14\$ = 34\$. More simply stated, the consumer's surplus is the total utility of the products bought minus the price actually paid. In this example, the total utility is \emph{at least} 34\$, and the price paid is 2$\times$14\$ = 28\$: therefore, Jane's consumer's surplus is 6\$. 
    \begin{center}
        \input{media/tikz/surplus}
    \end{center}
    Indeed, this example illustrates that \emph{surplus} and \emph{utility} are closely related; indeed, they only differ by the choice of a `set point' (the price at which Jane is buying tea). 

    Both have units of \$/yr, a consequence of the demand being in quantity/yr (of course `yr' is an arbitrary choice for a time unit for the sake of this example) -- this is an important distinction from other texts in economics, which tend to be rather vague as to whether the demand is a flow or an absolute quantity of goods. Based on this discussion, the following relations can be obtained:
    \begin{equation}
        \text{total surplus}\: =\: \sum_{i = 1}^{i^m} p_i \Delta v \qquad \text{consumer's surplus} \:=\: \sum p_i \Delta v - \underbrace{\sum p_m \Delta v}_{\text{amount paid}}
    \label{eq:surplus}
    \end{equation}
    with $p$ the price and $v$ the amount of tea sold per year. Hence, the summations happen over a set of prices between two points: a `reference' price (in this case, \$20), and the market price $p_m$; of course, the value of the consumer's surplus depends on the choice for these prices. Naturally, the market price may be quite undisputed, but the reference price is just that, and its choice is arbitrary. In this simple example, it happens to coincide with the reservation price for the first pound of tea, but that need not be the case at all.

   By virtue of the foregoing discussion, it is established that \emph{the trade utility measured at a given price is the (consumer's) surplus}. The Lagrangian represents an exchange of `trade utility' (dependent on the flow of goods) and the `product utility', dependent on stock levels. To establish the analogy with mechanics, observe that the part of the mechanical Lagrangian that depends on the generalized velocities is the kinetic energy. This connection is the foundation of the following economic engineering principle:
    \begin{quote}
        \textbf{Kinetic (co-)energy is analogous to market surplus.}
    \end{quote}
    In mechanics, the calculation of kinetic energy is \emph{dependent on the frame of reference}, and this is analogous to the reference price used to calculate the consumer's surplus. There is one additional loose end: in the example of Jane, there was extensive mention of price, while the Lagrangian and the kinetic co-energy are only dependent on the flow of goods. One can observe from the example that the price determines the additional increase of surplus for every increase in the amount of tea bought per year, or otherwise
    $$
        \frac{\Delta (\text{total utility})}{\Delta v} = p_i
    $$
    To generalize, one can assume that $v$ and $p$ are continuous variables instead, related to each other by the bijective `reservation price mapping' that is denoted by $m: v \mapsto p$. The summations in the previous examples can then all be replaced by integrals:
    $$ 
        \text{total utility} = \int p\dd{v} \qquad 
        \text{consumer's surplus} = \int p\dd{v} - p_1\int \dd{v}
    $$ 
    i.e. the total utility and consumer's surplus only differ by a choice of reference frame. With the consumer's surplus being analogous to kinetic energy, one can say that
    \begin{quote}
        \textbf{Price is analogous to momentum.}
    \end{quote}
    In this analogy, the `mass' plays the role of the market (in)elasticity, or the slope of the supply/demand line. Some generalizations are in order with respect to the classical notion of mass in mechanics. First of all, the elasticity is allowed to depend on the stock level, which is very common in economics (scarcity affects the supply and demand lines). Secondly, the product space (configuration manifold) is generally far from isotropic, i.e. mass is direction-dependent. This seems far from realistic for mechanical systems, but when one generalizes `mass' to the mass matrix found in the linearization of nonlinear mechanical systems, both position dependence and anisotropy are frequently encountered (e.g. double pendulum).

    \label{fig:kinetic_energy}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Potential energy}
In mechanics, the potential energy arises due to the presence of a conservative force vector field $\vec{F}$. A vector field is conservative if the work done along any path only depends on the endpoints of the path and not on the intermediate shape. If that is the case, then it is always true that one can find a function such that\footnote{This is a consequence of the fundamental theorem for line integrals \cite{Stewart2012}.}
$$ \vec{F} = - \pdv{U}{\vec{x}}. $$
In the Lagrangian context, the position vector $\vec{x}$ can be expressed in terms of the generalized coordinates, such that (with a slight abuse of notation)
$$ \vec{F} = -\pdv{U}{\gpos}. $$

\begin{econ}{Potential energy}
    While in `regular physics' potential energy arises due to the presence of elastic, electric, gravitational ... forces, its interpretation in economic engineering is related to the utility gained from the possession of goods; i.e. it is a function that has units of cash flow (just like surplus) that depends only on the stock levels (possibly in terms of generalized coordinates).\\

    The simplest example is the economic analogue of a spring: just like a spring, a restoring `force' (i.e. an economic want) occurs whenever the spring is elongated or stretched with respect to a certain reference distance. For economics agents, this means either being long or short on stock levels, again with respect to a certain reference $q_0$ (although important for practical interpretations, this reference does not really contribute on a conceptual level, which is why it is omitted in the theoretical discussion, just like the reference momentum for the kinetic energy). Hence, there is a `potential utility in either being long or short, in the sense that it can be exchanged for `market utility' or economic surplus, because it requires an exchange of goods. The continuous reciprocity between kinetic energy and 
    potential energy is a central theme in mechanics, and it is henceforth been given a succinct economic interpretation as well.
\end{econ}
The stereotypical example in mechanics that contains a single storage element of kinetic energy (a mass) and a single storage  element of potential energy (a spring) is the mass-spring system, which also arises as the linearization of a multitude of undamped nonlinear systems (i.e. the pendulum); the result is a second-order scalar autonomous differential equation:
\begin{equation}
    m\ddot{q} + \pdv{U}{q} = 0, \quad \text{with} U = \frac{kq^2}{2}
    \label{eq:mass_spring}
\end{equation}
with $k$ being the spring constant; this immediately results in Newton's second law of motion. A simple mass-spring system is shown in \cref{fig:mass_spring}.
\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \input{media/tikz/mass_spring}
    \caption{A simple mass-spring system. Figure courtesy of B. \citet{Krabbenborg2021}.}
    \label{fig:mass_spring}
\end{figure}

The distinction between energy and co-energy exists for potential energy too. Again, the potential energy itself is defined in terms of work: the integral of force over a distance. Comparable between the bijective simple linear relation between velocity and momentum, for simple linear springs the force $F$ and displacement $q$ are related by $F = kq$. Again, in this case, the distinction may seem a bit pointless; but, when this relation is nonlinear (as it is the real world often is), the potential energy and co-energy are no longer the same. 
$$ \text{potential energy } \epot = \int F \dd{q} \qquad \text{potential co-energy } \ecopot = \int q \dd{F} $$
which for in the case of the simple spring turn out to be
$$ \epot = \frac{kq^2}{2} \qquad \ecopot = \frac{f^2}{2k}. $$
In the case of potential energy, the familiar equation really \emph{is} the one that corresponds to energy (and not to co-energy, as for kinetic energy). The second equation seems really odd, intuitively turning the causal relation around, but one should bear in mind that this equation is, from a fundamental perspective, equally `odd' as the extremely familiar $\frac{mv^2}{2}$. \Cref{fig:potential_energy} shows the relation between potential energy and co-energy and why they are equal for a linear relation between force and displacement.
\begin{figure}[ht]

    \label{fig:potential_energy}
\end{figure}
The solution of the simple mass-spring system is a sinusoid that continues indefinitely in time. These `perfect' sinusoids are not often encountered in real economic systems. One must, however, bear in mind that (i) the perfect mass-spring system does not exist in mechanics either, and (ii) that economic systems are much harder to `decouple' from their surroundings due to the complex interconnected nature of society. This makes the theoretical achievement that are the basic foundations of economic engineering perhaps even more admirable. Because of these external factors, \cref{eq:mass_spring} will in practice usually contain external inputs in the form of forcing terms in lieu of the 0 after the equality sign, and \emph{dissipative terms} which indicate path-dependent forces in the system. 

\section{Hamiltonian mechanics}

\subsection{The Legendre transform}
Whereas the Lagrangian of a system is a function of its generalized positions and generalized velocities, the Hamiltonian is a function of the generalized position and generalized momentum. Recall from the definition that the generalized (or \emph{conjugate}) momenta are defined in terms of the Lagrangian; $p_i = \pdv{\lag}{\dot{q}_i}$. This change of variables is performed in a particular fashion called the \emph{Legendre transform}.

The total differential of the Lagrangian is
$$ \dd{\lag} = \pdv{\lag}{\gpos}\dd{\gpos} + \pdv{\lag}{\gvel}\dd{\gvel} + \pdv{\lag}{t}\dd{t}. $$
Two observations can be made: first, by definition, $\gmom = \pdv{\lag}{\gvel}$; and secondly, the Euler-Lagrange equations dictate that $\dv{\gmom}{t} = \pdv{\lag}{\gpos}$. As such, the total differential of the Lagrangian may be rewritten as: \cite{Landau1960}
$$ \dd{\lag} = \dot{\gmom}\dd{\gpos} + \gmom \dd{\gvel} + \pdv{\lag}{t}\dd{t}.$$
By means of the product rule $\dd{(\gmom \gvel)} = \gmom\dd{\gvel} + \gvel\dd{\gmom}$, the above can be rewritten as: 
\begin{equation}
    \dd{\underbrace{(\gmom\gvel - \lag)}_{\ham}} = \gvel\dd{\gmom} - \dot{\gmom}\dd{\gpos} - \pdv{\lag}{t}\dd{t}.
    \label{eq:diff_hamiltonian}
\end{equation}
The argument of the differential on the left-hand side is the \emph{Hamiltonian} $\ham$ of the system, i.e. 
$$ \ham(\gpos, \gmom, t) \triangleq \gmom \gvel - \lag(\gpos, \gvel, t). $$
This coincides with the Hamiltonian being the Legendre transform of the Lagrangian, given that the Lagrangian is a convex function (in $\gvel$). Roughly speaking, the Legendre transform of a function $f(\gvel)$ finds $g(\gmom) = \gmom\gvel - f(\gvel)$ is maximal, i.e. $\gvel(\gmom)$ is chosen such that $g(\gmom)$ is maximal. Clearly, $\gmom$ must be chosen such that $\gmom = \pdv{f}{\gvel}$. This is precisely how the generalized momentum is defined in terms of the Lagrangian, which automatically implies that the Hamiltonian is indeed the Legendre transform of the Lagrangian. The convexity of the function guarantees uniqueness and maximality.

The Legendre transform is involutive; that is, the $\ham$ and $\lag$ are the Legendre transform of each other; this is why they are called \emph{dual in the sense of Young} \cite{Arnold1989}. For the scalar case, a graphical explanation of the Legendre transform exists is provided by \cref{fig:legendre_transform}. Here, the function $g(p) = \max_x \{px - f(x)\}$; this optimality condition is met when $p = \dv{f}{x}$, i.e. where $px$ and $f(x)$ are locally parallel.

    \caption{Illustration of the Legendre transform. $g$ is the Legendre transform of the function $f$, as it maximizes the $px - f(x)$; this optimality is attained when $p = \dv{f}{x}$. In classical mechanics, this is extended to the multivariable case where $\lag$, $\ham$ and $\gvel$ take the role of $f$, $g$ and $x$ respectively.}

\begin{econ}{The Legendre transform in economics}
    In economics, the Lagrangian measures the exchange between market surplus and convenience yield. This exchange has the units of $\qty[\frac{\$}{\text{yr}}]$, and is in economic engineering sometimes named `cost' for short, although a definition in terms of utility would probably be more appropriate. The term $\gmom\gvel$ has a very clear interpretation in economics: it is the \emph{revenue} associated with the flow of goods and their prices. The Legendre transform then maximizes the difference between revenue and the Lagrangian `cost' with respect to the number of goods exchanged; $\gvel$. The optimality is guaranteed by the price representing the change of utility with respect to a change in the flow of goods.

    Because the Hamiltonian is equal to a difference between revenue and costs, its said to be analogous to earnings.
\end{econ}

\subsection{Hamilton's equations}
\Cref{eq:diff_hamiltonian} provides an expression for the total differential of the Hamiltonian, $\dd{\ham}$. By definition, this differential is equal to:
$$ \dd{\ham}(\gpos, \gmom, t) = \pdv{\ham}{\gpos}\dd{\gpos} + \pdv{\ham}{\gmom}\dd{\gmom} + \pdv{\ham}{t}\dd{t}. $$
Then, \cref{eq:diff_hamiltonian} gives rise to the following equalities:
\begin{equation}
    \gvel = \pdv{\ham}{\gmom} \qquad \dot{\gmom} = -\pdv{\ham}{\gpos} \qquad \pdv{\ham}{t} = - \pdv{\lag}{t},
    \label{eq:ham_eqs}
\end{equation}
which are known as \emph{Hamilton's equations}. The Hamiltonian combined with Hamilton's equations gives an equivalent representation of the system dynamics as the Lagrangian with the Euler-Lagrange equations.

In mechanics, the Hamiltonian corresponding to $\lag = \ecokin - \epot$, and where $\ecokin$ is the quadratic form given in \cref{eq:kinetic_energy}, the Hamiltonian is equal to:
\begin{equation}
    \ham = \ekin + \epot,
\end{equation}
which means that $\ham$ is equal to the \emph{total mechanical energy in the system}. A vital property of the Hamiltonian is that of its time (in)dependence, namely:
$$ 
\dv{\ham}{t} = \underbrace{\pdv{\ham}{\gpos}\dv{\gpos}{t} + \pdv{\ham}{\gmom}\dv{\gmom}{t}}_{=0} + \pdv{\ham}{t} \implies \dv{\ham}{t} = \pdv{\ham}{t},
$$
that is, the Hamiltonian is only time-varying if it features an explicit time-dependence. The vanishing of the first two terms is a direct consequence of Hamilton's equations. This property leads directly to the conservation of (mechanical) energy in time-invariant systems.

Whereas Lagrangian mechanics acts on the tangent bundle of the configuration manifold, Hamiltonian mechanics takes place in the \emph{cotangent bundle} $T^*M$, for it is expressed in terms of the momenta rather than the generalized velocities. The generalized momenta live in the cotangent space at a certaint point of the configuration manifold because they are the differential of a scalar function (the Lagrangian) on the manifold. The cotangent bundle is a vector bundle and thus a manifold in its own right; here the base manifold of the cotangent bundle is the configuration manifold $M$, the fibers are the cotangent space for each point. A natural 1-form can be defined on this cotangent bundle that exploits the distinction between the base manifold and the fibers; namely a 1-form on the co-tangent bundle that is `equivalent' to the covector in the cotangent space (with respect to their action on the tangent vector to the cotangent bundle and configuration manifold respectively). The action of this natural 1-form, which is called the \emph{tautological 1-form}, on a tangent vector to the cotangent bundle is equal to the action of the covector on this tangent vector \emph{under the pushforward of the projection map}. That is, if $\pi: T^*M \to M$ is the projection map, $\vec{\xi} \in T(T^*M)$ is a tangent vector to the cotangent bundle, and $m$ is an element of the cotangent bundle, the tautological 1-form $\omega^1$ is defined by \cite{Arnold1989,Abraham1978}
$$ \omega^1 = m\circ\pi_* \quad\text{or}\quad \omega^1(\vec{\xi}) = m(\pi_*(\vec{\xi})).  $$
In classical mechanics, $\omega^1$ is also named the \emph{Poincaré 1-form} or \emph{canonical 1-form}. The Poincaré 1-form can be expressed in canonical coordinates as follows:
$$ \omega^1 = \gmom\dd{\gpos}, $$
it is therefore a mathematical object that associates each component of the generalized momentum with the generalized position, and thus provides a fundamental connection between Hamiltonian and Lagrangian mechanics.

The exterior derivative of the Poincaré 1-form is a closed 2-form that is called the \emph{symplectic form};
$$ \omega^2 = \dd{\omega^1}.$$
In the given coordinates $\vec{q}$ and $\vec{p}$, the symplectic form is 
$$ \omega^2 = \dd{\vec{p}}\wedge\dd{\vec{q}}; $$
which makes the cotangent bundle $T^*M$ a symplectic manifold. The symplectic 2-form plays a similar role in symplectic geometry as the Riemannian metric does in Riemannian geometry; for example, by providing an isomorphism between the tangent and cotangent vectors. This isomorphism can be used to define the \emph{Hamiltonian vector field} \cite{Arnold1989}.
\begin{thmblock}{Hamiltonian vector field}
    Let $\ham$ be a function on a $2n$-dimensional symplectic manifold $(Q, \omega^2)$. The symplectic 2-form defined on $Q$ provides an isomorphism $I$ between its tangent and cotangent vectors, such that $\omega^2(\vec{\eta}, \vec{\xi}) = \omega^1_{\vec{\xi}}(\vec{\eta})$.  The vector field $I\dd{\ham}$ is called a Hamiltonian vector field, with $\ham$ being the hamiltonian function.
\end{thmblock}
A crucial property of the Hamiltonian vector field (and the corresponding Hamiltonian flow) is that it preserves the symplectic structure: \cite{Arnold1989}
$$ (g^t)^* \omega^2  = \omega^2, $$
i.e. where $(g^t)^*$ represents the pullback of the one-parameter group of diffeomorphisms of $Q$ that are governed by the Hamiltonian flow. Hence, the symplectic form is an integral invariant of the phase flow of the Hamiltonian system.  

\begin{econ}{The symplectic nature of economics}
    The preceding discussion presents the existence symplectic 2-form as a consequence of the phase space being the cotangent bundle of the configuration manifold. In economics, the existence of the symplectic structure is even more intuitive --- one could even argue that economics is evidently symplectic in the first place, and that the connection with classical mechanics is a consequence of this idea. If one asserts that the economy as a system `takes place' in the necessarily even-dimensional space of products and their prices, then there is only one, natural structure in economics that ties them together: the concept of money. More specifically, multiplying a number of products with their respective price allows one to `compare': this is precisely the role of money as the \emph{unit of account}, as stated by \citet{Mankiw2017}. Said otherwise, the area of the phase plane gives the economic space its defining structure, which in turn gives rise to the canonical 2-form $\dd{\vec{p}} \wedge \dd{\vec{q}}$. The area is signed because money is also `signed' from the perspective of an economic agent.

    The canonical 2-form is only symplectic if it obeys two additional requirements: it mus be closed and nondegenerate. Both requirements translate easily to economics:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \emph{Closed} means that the exterior derivative of the canonical 2-form is equal to zero. Crudely speaking, one could say that the exterior derivative is the `divergence' of the economic phase flow. If this divergence is zero, than the economic phase flow is incompressible with money being the notion of volume. Intuitively, this means that the 'value' of money is consistent throughout the phase flow. This makes sense from an economic perspective, for money wouldn't be very good as a unit of account if its value were inconsistent. Of course, some objections can be made, such as the existence of different currencies and inflation, but it is argued that these are not fundamental enough to violate this elementary principle. 
        \item \emph{Nondegenerate} means that there is no product for which any price is necessarily 0, i.e. nothing is inherently `free' in economics. Again, this is a reasonable (and even fundamental) assumption for an economic system.
    \end{itemize}
    Hence, the economic space of prices and products naturally exhibits a symplectic structure. This can be further supported by the fact that another type of structure for this space, say a Riemannian structure (e.g. something like $\dd{p}^2 + \dd{q}^2$), would make much less sense as it does not capture the role of money as means to compare and exchange goods of different nature.
    
    The reason why one can make the additional connection with classical mechanics is that the price-product space is a cotangent bundle. This in turn is motivated by the additional observation that the prices are the partial derivative of a products' utility with respect to its transaction rate, i.e. $\gmom = \pdv{\lag}{\gvel}$, i.e. the prices live in the fibers attached to the configuration manifold. Finally, there are the \emph{additional} assumptions about the form of the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian; i.e. that they can be used in the same form as those in classical mechanics ($\lag = \ecokin - \epot$, $\ham = \ekin + \epot$). Although the previous sections motivate that this is indeed a sensible thing to do, they are essentially additional assumptions on top of the symplectic structure and the nature of price. 
\end{econ}

\subsubsection{The canonical formalism}
%The Hamiltonian functions on a symplectic manifold form a Lie algebra where the \emph{Poisson bracket of functions} plays the role of the Lie bracket / commutator operation.
%\begin{thmblock}{Poisson brackets}
%    The Poisson bracket of the functions $F$ and $H$ is equal to the skew-scalar product of the velocity vectors of the phase flows with Hamiltonian functions $H$ and $F$
%    $$ \poisson{F}{H} = \omega^2(I\dd{H}, I\dd{F}). $$
%    In canonical coordinates, the Poisson bracket takes the form:
%    $$ \poisson{F}{H} = \pdv{H}{\gmom}\pdv{F}{\gpos} - \pdv{H}{\gpos}\pdv{F}{\gmom}.$$
%    The Poisson bracket is skew-symmetric bilinear and satisfies the Jacobi identity:
%    $$ \poisson{\poisson{A}{B}}{C} + \poisson{\poisson{B}{C}}{A} + \poisson{\poisson{C}{A}}{B} = 0 $$
%    with $A$, $B$, $C$ functions.
%\end{thmblock}
%The Poisson brackets allow easy notation for various properties of the Hamiltonian system. For example, Hamilton's equations can be expressed as:
%    $$ \gvel = \poisson{\gpos}{\ham} = \pdv{\ham}{\gmom} \qquad \dot{\gmom} = \poisson{\gmom}{\ham} = -\pdv{\ham}{\gpos}.$$
%Furthermore, a function $f$ is an integral of motion (a conserved quantity) if and only if its Poisson bracket with the Hamiltonian is zero:
%$$ \poisson{f}{\ham} = 0. $$
%Poisson brackets can be used to define the so-called \emph{canonical transformations}.
One of the great advantages of Hamiltonian mechanics is that it admits a much wider range of coordinate transformations. The Lagrangian formalism already allowed point-transformations, which simply apply to the configuration manifold (i.e. a change in generalized coordinates), where the conjugate momenta transform according to the Legendre transform. However, in the phase space the transformations may apply both to the momenta as the positions. Due to this large variety of transformations, the coordinates for \(\gpos\) and \(\gmom\) may no longer just pertain to a `spatial' component and a `momentum' component, this distinction will then just be a matter of definition \cite{Landau1960}. The `allowed' class of coordinate transformations, called the \emph{canonical transformations}, preserve the symplectic form $\omega^2$ and thus the form of Hamilton's equations \cite{Arnold1989}; they are \emph{symplectomorphisms} of the phase space. There is a rich variety in canonical transformations that can be helpful to better understand or integrate Hamiltonian systems; but this text will focus on one particular type that has been studied in economic engineering in the past: the action-angle coordinates.

\paragraph{Action-angle coordinates} A special choice of canonical coordinates arises for conservative systems, called the \emph{action-angle coordinates}. These are pairs of coordinates of the form $(\vec{I}, \vec{\phi})$, where $\vec{I}$ consists of the action coordinate and $\vec{\phi}$ are the angle coordinates. The reason why this set of coordinates exist in the first place is found in  Liouville's theorem, which states that when a system with $n$ degrees of freedom has $n$ independent first integrals $\vec{F}$, then the level set of these first integrals is diffeomorphic to the the $n$-dimensional torus $\mathbb{T}^n$. This torus is then completely parameterized by the $n$ action variables, while the angle coordinates determine the position on the torus. The action coordinates are functions of these first integrals as to ensure that the action-angle coordinate set is symplectic, i.e. \cite{Arnold1989}
$$ \omega^2 = \sum \dd{I_i} \wedge \dd{\phi_i}. $$
The major advantage of this particular choice of coordinates is that the corresponding differential equations are very easy to integrate. The action coordinates are constant over time, while the angle coordinates are characterized by a constant `angular velocity' --- another consequence of Liouville's theorem is that these systems are necessarily periodic. The angular velocity vector $\vec{\omega}$ depends on the value of the first integrals $\vec{f}$. That is, \cite{Arnold1989}
$$ \dv{\vec{I}}{t} = 0 \qquad \dv{\vec{\phi}}{t} = \vec{\omega}(\vec{f}) \implies \vec{\phi}(t) = \vec{\phi}(0) + \vec{\omega}t. $$
In the case where the cotangent bundle is $\real^{2n}$ (which is often the case for the linearized systems in economic engineering), the angle coordinates may constructed as follows:
\begin{equation}
    I_i(\vec{f}) = \frac{1}{2\pic}\oint_{\gamma_i} \gmom\dd{\gpos},
    \label{eq:action_coords}
\end{equation}
where $\gamma_1, \ldots, \gamma_n$ form a \emph{basis} for the one-dimensional cycles on the torus (that is, they each define a cycle in terms of one of the angle coordinates). This coordinate transformation can be shown to preserve the symplectic form.

\begin{econ}{Action-angle coordinates and the business cycle}
    Action-angle coordinates have been applied in past economic engineering research, most notably in the works of \citet{VanArdenne2020} and \citet{Vos2019}. Based on dimensional analysis, they have been used to model financial markets; however, it is the opinion of the author that this application is a bit \emph{ad hoc} and does not entirely respect the precise formal meaning of action-angle coordinates as outlined in this section. Rather, these coordinates can be used to express an economic system in terms of the `magnitude' of the business cycle, where the `angle' measures the phase of the business cycle (in Dutch, one would call this `\emph{conjunctuur}'). \Cref{eq:action_coords} essentially measures a total revenue over an entire business cycle, which has a characteristic frequency depending on the system parameters.

\end{econ}

\subsection{Noether's theorem}
Conservation principles play a vital role in physics and mechanics. Notable examples are the conservation of energy, linear momentum, angular momentum and charge. A surprising result in physics is that all of the mentioned conservation laws are a consequence of the same theorem, attributed to Emmy Noether. This theorem essentially looks at the nature of the Lagrangian of the system, and sees whether it is `ignorant' with respect to a certain group of transformations. As defined by \citet{Arnold1989}, the theorem is as follows:

\begin{thmblock}{Noether's theorem}
    If the Lagrangian system $(M, \lag)$ admits the one-parameter group of transformations $h^s: M \to M, s \in \real$, then the Lagrangian system of equations corresponding to $\lag$ has a first integral: $I: TM \to \real$. In local coordinates $q$ on $M$ the integral $I$ is written in teh form 
    $$ \left. I(\gpos, \gvel, t) = \pdv{\lag}{\gvel}\dv{h^s(\gpos)}{s}\right |_{s = 0} $$
\end{thmblock}
The word `admits' here means that the Lagrangian is invariant with respect to the transformation $h$; that is, the $\lag$ exhibits a \emph{symmetry} in that regard. A perspicuous consequence of this theorem is that when the Lagrangian has a cyclic coordinate (that is, it does not depend on some $q_i$), then the conjugate momentum of that coordinate is conserved, for the conjugate momentum of a coordinate $q_i$ is $\pdv{\lag}{\dot{q}_i}$.

\paragraph{Energy conservation} When the Lagrangian is time-invariant, one can define $h^s: (\gpos, t) \mapsto (\gpos, t + s)$ as translation in time. To find the conserved quantity, the Lagrangian has to be extended to consider the time $t$ as an explicit generalized coordinate, i.e. define
$$ \tilde{\lag}\qty(\gpos, t, \dv{\gpos}{\tau}, \dv{t}{\tau}) \triangleq \lag\qty(\gpos, \frac{\dv*{\gpos}{\tau}}{\dv*{t}{\tau}}, t)\dv{t}{\tau},$$
where $\tau$ now plays the role of the independent variable. This definition ensures that the action integral for $\tilde{\lag}$ and $\lag$ are identical, which is why Noether's theorem can be applied to $\tilde{\lag}$ instead. Of course, $\dv{h}{s}$ equal to 1 for the time coordinate; so there is one first integral
\begin{equation*}
    \begin{split}
        I = \pdv{\tilde{\lag}}{(t')} 
        &= \lag + \pdv{}{t'}\qty(\lag\qty(\gpos, \frac{
        \gpos'}{t'}, t))t'\\
        &= \lag + \pdv{\lag}{\gvel}\pdv{}{t'}\qty(\frac{
        \gpos'}{t'})t' = \lag - \pdv{\lag}{\gvel}\frac{\gpos'}{t'}\\
        &= \lag - \pdv{\lag}{\gvel}\gvel
    \end{split}
\end{equation*}
with $t' = \dv{t}{\tau}$ and $\gpos' = \dv{\gpos}{\tau}$. This is the negative of the Legendre transform of the Lagrangian, or the negative of the Hamiltonian; $I = -H$. Therefore, the total energy of the system is conserved. 

\paragraph{(Angular) momentum conservation} The invariance of the Lagrangian in one or more coordinate directions implies the conservation of the associated conjugate momentum. 

For example, a common assumption on Earth is that the gravitational force is constant and acts downwards. Therefore, only one coordinate appears in the potential energy expression, which is why the other coordinate directions (that is, the two `horizontal' directions, with proper choice of the coordinate system) are cyclic. Hence, by virtue of Noether's theorem, the linear momentum in those directions is conserved, for it is unaffected by any potential force.

Conservation of angular momentum often appears in the presence of so-called \emph{central} force fields, which means that the potential energy is a function of the \emph{distance} from a certain point: notable examples are Coulomb forces or gravitational forces in celestial mechanics. Because only distance matters, the orientation of the displacement vector between the origin of the force field and the body is of no importance; it will not appear in the Lagrangian either. Consequently, Noether's theorem dictates that these central force fields preserve angular momentum.

\begin{econ}{Noether's theorem and conservation in economics}
    Noether's theorem can be applied to economic systems as well. The most simple application is the conservation of prices in the absence of scarcity. When the utility Lagrangian does not depend on a certain stock level $q_i$, that essentially means that there is no utility associated with the possession (or shortage) of it; in other words, economic agents are not driven by scarcity (or abundance) of that particular product. The `conjugate momentum' of an economic good is its price; so \emph{in the absence of scarcity, price is conserved}.\\
    
    A similar comment about cyclic coordinates can be made in the rotational analogy (which is to be discussed in \cref{chap:finance_rotation}). If the utility Lagrangian is independent on the return or interest $\zeta$, then borrowers or lenders will be indifferent about the realized returns of their investments, and never capitalize them (or in the case of borrowers, never repay their debts).\\
    
    Finally, the conservation of income in the economic system is related to the time-invariance of its Lagrangian. The Lagrangian does not depend on time if (i) there are no external influences or forcing terms and (ii) all parameters in the system remain constant over time. If that is the case, the Hamiltonian (or total income) in the economic system is conserved; or volume in the phase space (i.e. total amount of money) is conserved.\\
    
    Admittedly, all of these interpretations are arguably rather straightforward, since they mostly rely on either the presence of cyclic coordinates or the direct correspondence of total energy and energy of the system. However, the discussion does prove that Noether's theorem has very tangible interpretations in economics. Its real power will, though, appear with more sophisticated symmetries that are present in complex economic systems. The idea is that the Lagrangian and Noether's theorem permit the extraction of `stylized facts' from these types of systems that would otherwise be concealed by their complexity. 
\end{econ}
