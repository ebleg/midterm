\begin{block}{Lagrangian system}
    Let \(M\) be a differentiable manifold, \(TM\) its tangent bundle, and \(\lag: TM \to \real\) a differentiable function. A map \(\gamma: \real \to M\)  is called a motion in the lagrangian system with configuration manifold \(M\) and lagrangian function \(\lag\) if \(\gamma\) is an extremal of the functional
    \[
     \Phi(\gamma) =  \int^{t_1}_{t_0} \lag\qty(\dot{\gamma})\dd{t}
\]
    where \(\dot{\gamma}\) is the velocity vector \(\dot{\gamma}(t) \in TM_{\gamma(t)}\) \cite{Arnold1989}.
