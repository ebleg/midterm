\chapter{The Lorentz-Minkowski Plane}
\label{chap:lorentz_plane}

In the previous chapter, it has been established that interest processes can be represented on hyperbolic curves by disregarding the time dimension and `decomposing' the exponential in a specific way. This result is almost trivially encapsulated in the identity
\begin{equation}
    \exp(\zeta) = \cosh(\zeta) + \sinh(\zeta)
    \label{eq:hyperbolic_identity}
\end{equation}
The most intuitive way to interpret this identity is by inspection of the Taylor series of the functions appearing in \cref{eq:hyperbolic_identity}:
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        \exp(x) &= \sum_{k = 0}^\infty \frac{x^k}{k!} = 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^3}{3!} + \ldots\\
        \cosh(x) &= \sum_{k = 0}^\infty \frac{x^{2k}}{(2k)!} = 1 + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^4}{4!} + \ldots\\
        \sinh(x) &= \sum_{k = 0}^\infty \frac{x^{2k + 1}}{(2k + 1)!} = x + \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^5}{5!} + \ldots\\
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
Or, alternatively, via the definition of the hyperbolic functions
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        \cosh(x) &\triangleq \frac{\exp(x) + \exp(-x)}{2}\\
        \sinh(x) &\triangleq \frac{\exp(x) - \exp(-x)}{2}
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
Clearly, the \(\cosh\) and \(\sinh\) functions are constructed by isolating the even or the odd powers respectively from the Taylor expansion of the exponential. The astute reader may notice that \cref{eq:effective_interest} bears some resemblance to Euler's formula \(\exp(\ii x) = \cos(x) + \ii \sin(x)\). As described by \citet{Needham1997}, this connection can be generalized by recognizing that
\[
     \cos(\ii x) = \cosh(x) \qquad \sin(\ii x) = \ii\sinh(x)
\]
As such, both the hyperbolic functions \(\sinh\), \(\cosh\) and the trigonometric functions \(\cos\) and \(\sin\) can all be represented by looking at the modular surface of \(|\sin(z)|\), visualized in \cref{fig:modular_sine}: of course, \(\sin\) and \(\cos\) only differ by a shift of \(\pic/2\) along the real line, and \(\cosh\) and \(\sinh\) exist at cross-sections into the complex at integer multiples of \(\pic/2\) and \(\pic\) respectively.

\section{Conic sections}

There are a variety of different (representations) of hyperbolae; in this case the discussion will be limited to so-called \emph{rectangular hyperbolae}, which are basically rotations, translations or a combination thereof of the scaled reciprocal function \(y = K/y\). The term `rectangular' refers to the fact that there is no squeeze or stretch along any particular direction. Although the term `rectangular hyperbola' therefore corresponds to a whole range of shapes, including the unit hyperbola which is to be defined later, it will henceforth be used here as a \emph{totum pro parte} to refer to the function \(y = K/y\) in particular in order accentuate the distinction with the unit hyperbola. An implicit parameterization of this rectangular hyperbola is 
\[
    \begin{cases}
        x =  \pm K\ec^t\\
        y = \pm K\ec^{-t}\\
    \end{cases} t \in \real,\ K \in \real^+_*
\]
Clearly, this hyperbola has two asymptotes along the \(x\) and \(y\) axes. The line \(x = y\) is called the \emph{major axis} of the hyperbola. By rotating the hyperbola over a \ang{45} angle in clockwise direction, the major axis will coincide with the \(x\)-axis, and a subsequent `squeeze' by factor \(\sqrt{2}/2\), one arrives at the so-called \emph{unit hyperbola} defined by the implicit equations \(x^2 - y^2 = K^2\). Applying this linear transformation (scale with \(\sqrt{2}/2\) and rotate by \(-\pi/4\)) as a matrix operation to the aforementioned parametric description, one arrives at 
\[
     \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\mqty(\sfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2} & \sfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \\ -\sfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2} & \sfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2})\mqty(\pm K\ec^t\\\pm K\ec^{-t}) 
  = \pm\frac{K}{2}\mqty(\ec^t + \ec^{-t}\\ \ec^{t} - \ec^{-t}) 
  = K\mqty(\pm \cosh(t)\\\sinh(t))
\]
which is the common parameterizaton of the unit hyperbola, this will be the standard representation throughout this text. Please note that the `\(\pm\)' in front of the \(\sinh\) can be disregarded because the \(\sinh\) is an odd function. One can now also recognize the asymptotes as an alternative axis system, which recovers the original hyperbola; this axis system will be referred to as the \emph{idempotent axis system}. The hyperbolae and the corresponding axis system are shown in \cref{fig:hyperbola_comparison}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \input{media/tikz/hyperbola_comparison}
    \caption{Comparison between the reciprocal function \((x, \tfrac{1}{x})\) and the unit hyperbola \((\cosh(t), \sinh(t))\) (implicit equation \(x^2 - y^2 = 1\)). The idempotent axis system (denoted by the gray lines) coincides with the asymptotes of the unit hyperbola; from this axis system the unit hyperbola again satisfies the equation \(x' y' = 1\).}
    \label{fig:hyperbola_comparison}
\end{figure}

\section{Hyperbolic angles}
Until now, the argument of the \(\sinh\)/\(\cosh\) parameterization has been \(t\) as is the familiar notation for a parametric curve. However, the duality between circles and hyperbolas can be exploited further by defining the arguments of the hyperbolic functions as \emph{hyperbolic angles}, like one does for the trigonometric functions \(\sin\) and \(\cos\), which could be named `circular' angles to further highlight the distinction. In both cases, an angle refers to a certain region bounded by the curve (hyperbola/circle) at issue. The standard notation for the hyperbolic angle will be \(\zeta\), in accordance to the rapidity from special relativity which can also be viewed as a hyperbolic angle as will be discussed later on. 
\begin{block}{Hyperbolic sector}
A hyperbolic sector is the region bounded by two lines extending from the origin to each to a point on the (unit) hyperbola, and the graph of the hyperbola itself. 
\end{block}
Clearly, hyperbolic sectors are entirely analogous to their `traditional' circular cousins. Fixing one of the rays to the \(x\)-axis, one can define the corresponding hyperbolic angle:
\begin{block}{Hyperbolic angle}
A hyperbolic angle corresponding to a point \(A\) is defined as twice the area of the hyperbolic sector based on the point \(A\) and the intersection point of the unit hyperbola and the \(x\)-axis \((K, 0)\).
\end{block}
Clearly, any point on a hyperbola with radius \(K\) can be parameterized using \[
     \qty(K\cosh(\zeta), K\sinh(\zeta))
\] By allowing the radius \(K\) to be negative, all the points in the disconnected open set bounded by \(y = x\) and \(y = -x\) can be identified with a unique radius \(K\) and hyperbolic angle \(\zeta\). This is somewhat similar to polar coordinates, which is why these coordinates will be referred to as `hyperbolic polar coordinates'.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
    \centering
    \input{media/tikz/hyperbolic_angle}
    \caption{Illustration of a hyperbolic angle along the hyperbola with semi-major axis \(K\).}
    \label{fig:hyperbolic_angle}
\end{figure}
It may already be clear that hyperbolic polar coordinates do \emph{not} provide coordinates for the entire plane like regular polar coordinates do. Indeed, the mapping defined by the coordinate functions from the \(K-\zeta\) space to the \(x\)-\(y\) space is neither injective nor surjective: its image is the disconnected open set bounded by the lines \(y = x\) and \(y = -x\) (not surjective), and the entire line \(K = 0\) in the \(K-\zeta\) plane is mapped to the origin in the \(x-y\) plane (not injective). As such, one can obtain a bijection by disregarding the degenerate cases for which \(K = 0\) and restricting the codomain of the mapping to the set \(\qty{(x, y) \in \real^2: \abs{x} > \abs{y}}\). The action of the mapping is illustrated by \cref{fig:polar_coords}.
\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \input{media/tikz/polar_coords}
    \caption{}
    \label{fig:polar_coords}
\end{figure}

A possible workaround for this problem can be found in the so-called \emph{generalized trigonometry} as described by \citet{Harkin2004}: in this case, the notion of the hyperbolic angle itself is considered ambiguous and must be accompanied the branch of the hyperbola that is associated with the angle. In this case four hyperbolic branches are considered, so both branches of \(x^2 - y^2 = K^2\) combined with \(y^2 - x^2 = K^2\) which were disregarded up till now.\footnote{In fact, \citeauthor{Harkin2004} provide an even more general treatment, covering so-called generalized complex numbers of the form \(z = x + \iota y\quad x, y \in \real\) with \(\iota^2 = \iota q + p\quad p, q \in \real\). However, in this case \(p = 1\) and \(q = 0\), as will become clear later in the discussion about hyperbolic numbers.}
\begin{equation}
    \zeta = 
    \begin{cases}
        \tanh[-1](x/y) & \text{for branches I and III}\\
        \tanh[-1](y/x) = \coth[-1](x/y) & \text{for branches II and IV}\\
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
Although this extended definition brings the other two quadrants of the hyperbolic plane within reach of the polar form as well, there is still a particular set that even now cannot be represented this way: \(\qty{(x, y)\mid \abs{x} = \abs{y}}\), or the `light cone' from special relativity.

\section{Introduction to the theory of special relativity}
This section gives a basic outline of the theory of special relavity. It is by no means meant to be a comprehensive overview, for which many other excellent resources exist such as \citet{Misner1970}, \citet{Taylor1992}, \citet{Landau1971}, or \citet{Penrose1978} for a shorter, less technical introduction. Instead, the goal of this section is to give a physical context for the concept of Lorentz geometry and the associated Lorentz space and metric, as well as their connection with hyperbolic geometry and Möbius transforms which will be introduced in \cref{chap:hyperbolic_geometry} and \cref{chap:moebius_transforms}.

Before the advent of the theory of special relativity, developed by i.a. Poincaré, Minkowski, Lorentz and Einstein, so-called `Galilean relativity' was the norm. Galilean relativity entails the definition of Galilean transformations which links reference frames that move relative to each other at a constant linear speed. The laws of physics should be invariant between these inertial reference frames. However, a problem presented itself in the form of the famous Maxwell equations that pose the governing laws in electromagnetism. A consequence from Maxwell's laws is the finite propagation speed of light and therefore all possible interactions between particles in the universe. It is not hard to imagine that the Galilean invariance breaks down as a result of the introduction of a `special' speed - indeed, the Galilean transform proclaims a complete independence between the physical laws and the constant velocity of the frame in which they are applied. But, as a direct consequence from Maxwell's equations, the laws of physics in a moving reference frame \emph{will} depend on the speed of that particular reference frame: a major inconsistency with the traditional train of thought.

The new principle of relativity that brought reconciliation with Maxwell's ideas not only required space to be relative (i.e. dependent on a frame of reference), but also views \emph{time as a relative concept} whereas it had always been assumed to be absolute in classical mechanics. As such, the notion of time is dependent on the choice of reference frame too. This has the immediate consequence that the traditional three-dimensional setting of classical mechanics (often with Cartesian coordinates \(x, y, z\)) will not suffice for the description of special relativity: a fourth coordinate four time is indespensable to incorporate the relativity of time. Points in the four-dimensional \emph{spacetime} are called \emph{world points}, their associated trajectories are \emph{world lines} \cite{Landau1971}.
\index{world line}
\index{world point}

\subsection{Spacetime intervals}
Overwhelming experimental evidence has pointed out that the propagation of light is completely independent of its direction. This can be encapsulated in spacetime by means of \emph{spacetime intervals} which provide a notion of distance between two world points. If a signal travels at the speed of light \(c\), the distance between two world points along its trajectory should be zero. The spatial distance squared between two points is equal to
\index{spacetime interval}
\[ \qty(x_2 - x_1)^2 + \qty(y_2 - y_1)^2 + \qty(z_2 - z_1)^2 \]
whereas the distance squared covered by a signal travelling at the speed of light is equal to 
\[c^2(t_2 - t_1)^2. \]
Therefore, the spacetime interval between two world points is
\[
    s_{12} = \sqrt{c^2(t_2 - t_1)^2 - \qty(x_2 - x_1)^2 - \qty(y_2 - y_1)^2 - \qty(z_2 - z_1)^2}
\]
which will amount to zero for the world lines corresponding to a signal travelling at the speed of light. For an infinitesimal distance \(\dd{s}\), the spacetime interval can be expressed as
\[ \dd{s}^2 = c^2 \dd{t}^2 - \dd{x}^2 - \dd{y}^2 - \dd{z}^2.\]
The spacetime interval is the same in any inertial reference frame. This is the mathematical translation of the invariance of the speed of light in the universe \cite{Landau1971}. Based on the sign of the spacetime interval, three classes can be distinguished.
\begin{itemize}
    \item If \(s_{12}^2 > 0\), the interval is \emph{timelike} and there exists a frame of reference in which both events occured \emph{at the same location} in space, they are simply separated by the passage of time \(t_{12} = \frac{s_{12}}{c}\); 
    \item in contrast, when \(s_{12}^2 < 0\), the interval is \emph{spacelike} and the events are `too far apart' to reach within the limits of the speed of light --- the events must therefore be at different locations (absolutely remote), and there exists a reference frame in which the events occur \emph{simultaneously} at distance \(l_{12} = \ii s_{12}\);
    \item intervals for which \(s_{12}^2 = 0\) are called \emph{lightlike}, because only light can travel between these events.
\end{itemize}
\index{lightlike}
\index{spacelike}
\index{timelike}
Now, one can ask the question what the actual time is that an observer would experience in uniform motion, i.e. what difference in time is there on clocks which have been travelling at different velocities? The time experienced by an observer is called \emph{proper time}, and it can be computed by evaluating the following path integral:
\begin{equation}
    t'_2 - t'_1 = \int^{t_2}_{t_1} \dd{t} \sqrt{1 - \qty(\frac{v}{c})^2}.
    \label{eq:proper_time}
\end{equation}
Clearly, if the velocity makes up a larger fraction of the speed of light, the proper time is lower; that is: moving clocks run slower than a clock at rest (hypothetical clocks travelling at the speed of light do not register the passage of time whatsoever). 
\towrite{Twin paradox ?}

\subsection{Lorentz transformations}
As mentioned, special relativity corrects the flaw of the Galilean transforms, which represent the classical view of inertial reference systems: for example, if one coordinate system moves at constant velocity with respect to the other in \(x\)-direction (the coordinate directions are assumed to coincide for simplicity), the Galilean transform takes the form:
\begin{equation}
    x = x' + Vt, \quad y = y', \quad z = z',\quad t = t'.
    \label{eq:galilean_transform}
\end{equation}
The statement \(t = t'\) encodes the traditional assumption in mechanics that time has an absolute character. Of course, it is precisely this statement that is refuted by special relativity. As such, one could devise a new type of transformation that takes this (and the invariance of spacetime intervals between events, as discussed in the previous section) into account. These transformations are called \emph{Lorentz transformations}. 

As described by \citet{Landau1971}, these transformations comprise the rotations in four-dimensional space: since there are six ways to pick a plane (or two coordinates) from a set of four axes, every rotation in four-space can be decomposed into six successive rotations. Of these six rotations, three are purely spatial: they are the familiar rotations that can be parameterized by e.g. Euler angles. On the other hand, the three other rotations involve time as well, and they are of a different nature. Whereas the spatial rotations are circular, the time-rotations are hyperbolic (they are represented by hyperbolic functions rather than trigonometric functions). For example, a rotation in the \(tx\)-plane would take the following form:
\begin{equation}
    x = ct'\sinh(\zeta)\qquad ct = ct'\cosh(\zeta);
    \label{eq:lorentz_transform_hyp}
\end{equation}
\index{Lorentz!transformation}
or, using the fact that \(V = x/t\):
\begin{equation}
    x = \largefrac{x' + Vt'}{\sqrt{1 - \qty(\frac{V}{c})^2}} \qquad t = \frac{t' + \largefrac{V}{c^2}x'}{\sqrt{1 - \qty(\frac{V}{c})^2}} \qquad y = y' \qquad z = z';
    \label{eq:lorentz_transform_sqrt}
\end{equation}
which also indicates that the hyperbolic (boost) angle \(\zeta\) can be written in terms of the velocity \(V\) of one frame with respect to the other
\[ \tanh(\zeta) = \frac{V}{c},\]
which means that the argument of the hyperbolic rotation purely depends on the relative velocity between the two reference frames as a fraction of the speed of light. A few observations can be be made based on these equations: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Clearly, \(V\) cannot be larger than \(c\); there is no real \(\zeta\) for which this could be true. This again reaffirms the statement that there can be no motions with velocities larger than the speed of light.
    \item Secondly, this transform keeps \(c^2t^2 - x^2\) unaffected (of course, \(z\) and \(y\) keep their value for obvious reasons); all points in the \(tx\)-plane that remain invariant under this type of transformations lie on the same hyperbola. This underlines the connection with the capital-yield plane discussed in the previous sections: in that analogy, the accumulated interest corresponds to the Lorentz boost \(\zeta\).
    \item In the limit for \(c \to \infty\), the original Galilean transform is recovered; as such, the original laws still function as an approximation when \(V\) is of negligible size with respect to \(c\).
    \item Due to the multiplication factor in the transform, two points \(x_1\) and \(x_2\) are closer together when travelling at speed than when they are at rest. A length measured in a rest frame are called \emph{proper} \index{proper length}, and contracts when in a moving frame: this phenomenon is called \emph{Lorentz contraction} \index{Lorentz!contraction} \cite{Landau1971}.
    \item In contrast to Galilean transforms, Lorentz transforms are generally not commutative: just like regular three-dimensional rotations, they depend on the order in which they are applied.
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Velocity transform} The Lorentz transform described by \cref{eq:lorentz_transform_hyp,,eq:lorentz_transform_sqrt} shows how to transform coordinates from one frame to another. However, because the transform affects both \(x\) and \(t\), a velocity measured in the frame (not to be confused with the relative velocity between the frames \(V\)) \(\vec{v}\) with components will see not only its \(x\)-component affected, but the other two components \(v_x\) and \(v_z\) as well. The transformation of \(\vec{v}\) to \(\vec{v}'\) is then:
\begin{equation}
    v_x = \largefrac{v_x' + V}{\sqrt{1 - \qty(\frac{V}{c})^2}}\qquad 
    v_y = \largefrac{v_y'\sqrt{1 - \qty(\frac{V}{c})^2}}{1 + v_x'
    \qty(\frac{V}{c})}\qquad
    v_z = \largefrac{v_z'\sqrt{1 - \qty(\frac{V}{c})^2}}{1 + v_x'\qty(\frac{V}{c})}. \text{\cite{Landau1971}}
    \label{eq:lorentz_transform_vel}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Four-vectors}
\index{four-vector}
Instead of the usual three-vectors that are common in classical mechanics, the points in four-dimensional spacetime may be regarded as elements in a four-dimensional vector space instead:
\begin{equation}
    A^0 = ct\qquad A^1 = x \qquad A^2 = y \qquad A^3 = z;
    \label{eq:four-vector}
\end{equation}
where the superscript indices indicate \emph{contravariant} (vector) components. These can be converted to covariant indices by virtue of the metric tensor \tens{g}
\index{metric tensor}
\[g_{ij} = g^{ij} = \mqty(\dmat[0]{1, -1, -1, -1}).\]
Using \tens{g}, indices can then be lowered (or raised) like so
\[ A^0 = A_0\qquad A^1 = -A_1 \qquad A^2 = -A_2 \qquad A^3 = -A_3; \]
such that the spacetime interval may be expressed in tensor notation (observing the Einstein summation convention) as
\[ s^2 = A^i A_i = c^2t^2 - x^2 - y^2 - z^2.\]
Much like position, velocities have a four-dimensional spacetime counterpart as well; these objects are called \emph{four-velocities}, they are defined as \cite{Landau1971}\index{four-velocity}
\[ u^i = \dv{x^i}{s} \qquad \text{ with } \dd{s} = c\dd{t} \sqrt{1 - \qty(\frac{v}{c})},\]
\(v\) being the three-dimensional velocity of the particle. The components of the four-velocity are then
\[ 
u^0 = \largefrac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \qty(\frac{v}{c})^2}} 
\qquad  u^1 = \largefrac{v_x}{c\sqrt{1 - \qty(\frac{v}{c})^2}}
\qquad  u^2 = \largefrac{v_y}{c\sqrt{1 - \qty(\frac{v}{c})^2}}
\qquad  u^3 = \largefrac{v_z}{c\sqrt{1 - \qty(\frac{v}{c})^2}}
\]
which are all dimensionless quantities. Clearly, any four-velocity squared amounts to one; or \(u^i u_i = 1\). This is analogous to the statement that all four-velocities live on a four-dimensional \emph{unit hyperboloid} (due to the nature of the metric tensor); this means that the four-velocities \emph{do not} form a vector space; the sum of two four-velocities does not generally yield another four-velocity. Instead, four-velocities exhibit a special type of geometry called \emph{hyperbolic geometry} --- this is an important concept to which \cref{chap:hyperbolic_geometry} is entirely devoted.

\subsection{Relativistic mechanics}
As described by \citet{Landau1971}, the Lagrangian for a relativistic particle is 
\[\lag = -mc^2\sqrt{1 - \qty(\frac{v}{c})^2}\]

\section{The Lorentz metric}
\label{sec:lorentz_metric}
\index{Lorentz!metric}
\index{Lorentz!norm}
\index{Lorentz!product}
Central in the discussion of interest movements as hyperbolic motions will be the so-called Lorentzian inner (or Lorentz) product

\begin{block}{Lorentz product}
    Let \(\vec{u}, \vec{v}\) be vectors in \(\real^n\). The \emph{Lorentzian inner product} of \(\vec{u}\) and \(\vec{v}\) is defined to be the real number
    \[
     \vec{u} \diamond \vec{v} = u_1v_1 - u_2v_2 - \ldots - u_nv_n
\]
\end{block}
The Lorentz product is an inner product, which means that it takes two elements from a vector space and returns a scalar value, while satisfying two (or three) conditions: (1) bilinearity, (2) symmetry and (3) nondegeneracy \cite{Ratcliffe2019}.

In some literature, the condition of nondegeneracy is replaced by a stronger notion of positive definiteness, which means that an inner product of a vector with itself is always nonnegative and zero if and only if the vector is the zero vector. However, this condition does not apply to the Lorentz product --- this fact has rather far-reaching ramifications, as will become clear with the next definition. 

Based on the Lorentz inner product it is natural to define also a corresponding \emph{Lorentzian norm} \(\lnorm{\cdot}\):
    \[
     \lnorm{\vec{v}} = \qty(\vec{v}\diamond\vec{v})^\frac{1}{2}
\]
Because the Lorentz product is not positive definite but rather indefinite, the result of \(\vec{v}\diamond\vec{v}\) is not guaranteed to be a positive number. As such, \(\lnorm{\vec{v}} \in \complex\), in stark contrast with the familiar Euclidean norm which \emph{is} positive definite and will therefore always return a nonnegative real number.

The norm provides a notion of length for a vector. Based on this length, a \emph{metric} yields a distance between two points, i.e. the distance between \(\vec{u}\) and \(\vec{v}\) is equal to 
\[
     d_L(\vec{v}, \vec{u}) \triangleq \lnorm{\vec{v} - \vec{u}}
\] 
Because the norm is not positive definite but `only' nondegenerate, it is called a \emph{pseudo-Euclidean metric}, and the vector space it is associated with a \emph{pseudo-Euclidean space}. A vector space equipped with this pseudometric (in more general terms, a bilinear nondegenerate form) is called a Lorentz space. The particular case for \(\real^4\) sets the stage for the theory of special relativity (with one `special' dimension for time and three spatial dimensions) and is called the Minkowski space, after the German physicist Hermann Minkowski \cite{Catoni2008}. Sometimes the two-dimensional plane that is discovered here is also called the Minkowski plane, because this is what he used to explain his ideas, being unable to draw anything like four-dimensional space. However, this text will adhere to the more mathematically inclined tradition and call it `Lorentz(ian) space' which applies for any dimension larger than one \cite{Ratcliffe2019}. 

The sign of the Lorentz norm gives rise to an equivalence relation \(\sim_L\) defined to be \(a \sim_L b \iff \sgn{\norm{a}} = \sgn{\norm{b}}\).\footnote{An equivalence relation is a binary relation that is symmetric, reflexive and transitive.} Therefore, the \emph{quotient set} of all the points in the plane \(\real / \sim_L \) contains three elements \(\qty{-1, 0, 1}\), these equivalence classes are given the respective names \(\qty{\text{\texttt{spacelike}}, \text{\texttt{lightlike}}, \text{\texttt{timelike}}}\) based on the terminology from special relativity \cite{Landau1971}.

\begin{figure}[ht]

The lines \(y = x\) and \(y = -x\) containing all the lightlike vectors form the so-called light cone or null cone. The hyperbola of in the spacelike region (dark gray) obey the equation \(y^2 - x^2 = K^2\), they will be referred to the hyperbolic branches II (\(y > 0\)) and IV (\(y < 0\)). In contrast, the timelike hyperbolic branches with equation \(x^2 - y^2 = K^2\) (light gray region) are referred to as I (\(x > 0\)) and III (\(x < 0\)).}
    \label{fig:lightlike_spacelike}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{About the metric signature}
In literature (both physics and mathematics) many variations on the so-called `metric signature' of the Lorentz product make their appearance. In terms of \(\real^4\), these variations come down to \((+,-,-,-)\), \((-,-,-,+)\), \((-,+,+,+)\) and \((+,+,+,-)\), where the first one coincides with the definition used here, in accordance with the magnificent work of \citet{Landau1971}. Luckily, this is just a matter of convention and its influence on the mathematical machinery at hand is limited to the switching of some signs.

\section{The Lorentz group}


\section{Hyperbolic numbers}
Perhaps the most convenient way to view the hyperbolic motions is in terms of so-called hyperbolic numbers\footnote{The hyperbolic number system has been assigned a myriad of names, with different terminology and mathematical notation for almost every influential paper that has been published about them. Among others, hyperbolic numbers are referred to as split-complex numbers, double numbers, perplex numbers, algebraic motors, etc. In this text, `hyperbolic numbers' is chosen to highlight their connections with hyperbolae. For the choice of the hyperbolic unit, \(\jj\) will be used, though in literature also \(\mathrm{u}\) (for unipotent) and \(\mathrm{h}\) (for hallucinatory or hyperbolic) make their appearance \cite{Fjelstad1986, Sobczyk1995, Motter1998, Harkin2004}.}. These form an alternative number system similar to complex numbers, based on the `hyperbolic' unit \(\jj\) with the defining unipotence property \(\jj^2 = 1\), where obviously \(\jj \notin \real\). Like complex numbers, the hyperbolic numbers can have a real and a hyperbolic part
\[
     z = x + y\jj \qquad x, y \in \real
\]
Combined with addition and multiplication defined on them, the hyperbolic numbers form a commutative ring. Each hyperbolic number \(z\) is associated with its \emph{hyperbolic conjugate} \(z^* = x - y\jj\). The product of a hyperbolic number with its own hyperbolic conjugate creates a quadratic form \(zz^* = x^2 - y^2\), which always returns a real number and is equivalent Lorentzian metric. Again, three cases can be distinguished for \(z\):
\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{timelike} when \(zz^* > 0\)
    \item \emph{lightlike} when \(zz^* = 0\)
    \item \emph{spacelike} when \(zz^* < 0\)
\end{itemize}
However, in contrast to complex numbers (whose quadratic form would be \(x^2 + y^2\)), this quadratic form is \emph{isotropic}, which means that there exists a \(z \neq 0\) such that \(zz^* = 0\) --- this is precisely the case for all the \(z\) on the light cone in the hyperbolic plane. The \emph{hyperbolic modulus} therefore requires an absolute value in order like so
\[
     \abs{z} \triangleq \sqrt{\abs{zz^*}}
\]
which considered to be the hyperbolic distance from \(z\) to the origin \cite{Sobczyk1995}.

Again, in correspondence with complex numbers, the hyperbolic numbers also have a  \emph{polar form}, i.e.
\[
     z = K \exp(\zeta \jj)
\]
which can be evaluated using the Taylor expansion of the exponential \(\exp\):
\[
     z = K\exp(\zeta \jj) = K \sum^\infty_{k = 0} \frac{(\zeta \jj)^k}{k!} =  K \sum^\infty_{k = 0} \frac{(\zeta \jj)^{2k}}{(2k)!} + K \sum^\infty_{k = 0} \frac{(\zeta \jj)^{2k+1}}{(2k + 1)!} = K\cosh(\zeta) + K\jj\sinh(\zeta)
\]
when the hyperbolic angle \(\zeta\) is associated with hyperbolic branches I and III. For branches II and IV, one essentially has to consider \(z = K\jj\exp(\zeta\jj)\) or
\[
     z = K\sinh(\zeta) + K\jj\cosh(\zeta)
\]

Furthermore, consider the \emph{conjugate product} of two hyperbolic numbers \(z_1 = x_1 + y_1\jj\) and \(z_2 = x_2 + y_2\jj\):
\[
     z_1^*z_2 = \underbrace{(x_1x_2 - y_1y_2)}_\text{inner product} 
            + \underbrace{(x_1y_2 - x_2y_1)}_\text{outer product}\jj
\]
of the resulting expression, the real part is called the inner product and the hyperbolic part the outer product. The inner product is equivalent to the Lorentz product while the outer product yields the directed area of the parallelogram spanned by \(z_1\) and \(z_2\) (or the determinant of \(\mqty(x_1 & x_2\\y_1&y_2)\). The outer product is the same as for regular complex numbers, while the inner product recovers the Lorentz inner product instead of the Euclidean inner product. This is why one can say that the hyperbolic number plane and the complex plane have an identical notion of area. Based on the inner product, one can however recognize a different notion of orthogonality, i.e. \(z_1\) and \(z_2\) are \emph{hyperbolically orthogonal} if their hyperbolic inner product equals zero --- this will yield a different notion of orthogonality than their Euclidean counterpart \cite{Needham1997, Sobczyk1995}.

\subsection{Matrix representation}
For many algebraic structures (groups, rings, fields, ...) an isormorphism can be found in the rhealm of linear algebra, by identifying a specific class of matrices. For example, the complex number system \(a + b\ii\) is isomorphic to the matrices
\[
     \mqty(a & -b \\ b & a) \quad a, b \in \real.
\]
Likewise, one can establish an isomorphism between the hyperbolic numbers and a certain class of matrices. The hyperbolic number system defined with addition and multiplication defined on it are ring-isomorphic to the matrix ring
\[
     \mqty(x & y \\ y & x) \quad x, y \in \real
\]
under matrix addition and matrix multiplication. The determinant of said matrix then recovers the Lorentz metric
\[
     \det \mqty(x & y \\ y & x) = x^2 - y^2
\]

\subsection{The idempotent basis}
Previously it was already mentioned that the hyperbola can be viewed conveniently in two particular axis systems, the standard axis system and the idempotent axis system, as illustrated in \cref{fig:hyperbola_comparison}. This basis can also be defined in terms of hyperbolic numbers; in terms of the standard basis \(\qty{1, \jj}\) the idempotent basis is \(\qty{\jjp, \jjm}\) with 
\[
     \jjp = \frac{1}{2}(1 + \jj) \qquad \jjm = \frac{1}{2}(1 - \jj)
\]
The term `idempotent' is a testament to the fact that \(\jjp^2 = \jjp\) and \(\jjp^2 = \jjp\). As such, a given hyperbolic number \(z = x + y\jj\) in idempotent coordinates is 
\[
     \underbrace{\qty(x + y)}_{z_{_+}}\jj_{_+} + \underbrace{\qty(x - y)}_{z_{_-}}\jjp
\]
Furthermore, the idempotent basis is mutually annihilating, i.e. \(\jjp \jjm = 0\), which is why they possess a projective property: \cite{Sobczyk1995}
\[
     z\jjp = z_{_+}\jjp\quad\text{and}\quad z\jjm = z_{_-}\jjm
\]
The idempotent axis system is interesting because it returns the total amount compounded or discounted over time; in contrast to the standard yield-capital decomposition.
