\section{Basic facts}
Hyperbolic geometry, sometimes called Lobachevskian geometry\footnote{After the Russian mathematician Nikolai Lobachevsky (1832) who first published about this subject \cite{Needham1997}.} is the geometry on the hyperbolic plane. This type of geometry is called non-Euclidean, because it does not satisfy all of Euclid's axioms that form the building blocks of traditional  geometry. More specifically, the fifth axiom, called the parallel axiom, states that \cite{Needham1997}
\begin{quote}
    Through any point \(p\) not on the line \(L\) there exists precisely one line \(L'\) that does not meet \(L\).
\end{quote}
Logic dictates that if this axiom is not true, two possible alternatives arise. Given again the point \(p\) and the line \(L\), 
\begin{itemize}
    \item there exists \emph{no} line through \(p\) that does not meet \(L\), or
    \item there exist \emph{at least two} lines through \(p\) that do not meet \(L\).
\end{itemize}
The first statement corresponds to what is called \emph{spherical geometry}, while the latter is the defining axiom for \emph{hyperbolic geometry}. It does not take too much imagination to realize that the parallel axiom is equivalent to another basic fact in Euclidean geometry: the sum of the angles of a triangle is equal to \(\pi\). As such, for both types of non-Euclidean geometry this will not be the case; let \(\mathcal{E}(T)\) denote the \emph{angular excess} of a triangle \(T\) in a certain geometry.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Naturally, for Euclidean geometry \(\mathcal{E}(T) = 0\),
    \item in spherical geometry, \(\mathcal{E}(T) > 0\),
    \item in hyperbolic geometry, \(\mathcal{E}(T) < 0\).
\end{itemize}
It may come as a surprise that the angular excess can be related to the size of the triangle (more specifically, its area) like so \cite{Needham1997}
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{E}(T) = k\mathcal{A}(T)
    \label{eq:angular_excess} 
\end{equation}
where \(k = 0\) for Euclidean geometry, \(k < 0\) for hyperbolic geometry and \(k > 0\) for spherical geometry. This hints at the fact that spherical geometry and hyperbolic geometry are somehow `larger' classes of geometry than Euclidean geometry, since they exist for a whole range of values for \(k\), be it positive or negative. There is indeed a `different' geometry for every value of \(k\), and only one of those values corresponds to the traditional concept of Euclidean geometry that most people are familiar with. Another consequence of \cref{eq:angular_excess} is that similar triangles cannot exist in non-Euclidean geometry; since apart from the trivial case where the triangles are also congruent, they must differ in area, which yields a different angular excess. The value of \(k\) is, as it turns out, equal to the \emph{Gaussian curvature} of the surface: a negatively curved surface has an angular deficiency while a positively curved surface has an angular excess; only for surface with zero curvature the sum of the angles of a triangle will be precisely equal to \(\pic\).

\subsection{Surface curvature}
\label{ssec:curvature}
Perhaps one of the most remarkable results attributed to Carl Friedrich Gauss is his \emph{Theorema Egregium} about the (Gaussian) curvature of surfaces. The theorem states that curvature is an \emph{intrinsic} property, which means that it remains preserved when the surface is transformed by `bending without stretching'. Curvature can be positive, negative or zero. Positively curved surfaces `bend away' from their tangent plane in any direction (local convexity) and negatively curved surfaces intersect their tangent plane like a saddle. For surfaces with zero curvature, there is always at least one straight line that lies in the tangent plane; examples are a cylinder (always one straight line) and a plane (straight lines in two directions). If a coordinate system is defined such that the point at issue is at the origin and the tangent plane to the surface described by \(f(x, y)\) coincides with the horizontal, the Gaussian curvature can be computed by means of the determinant of the Hessian \cite{Thurston1997, ONeill2006}
    \[ 
        k = \det \begin{pmatrix}
                f_{xx} & f_{xy}\\
                f_{yx} & f_{yy}
        \end{pmatrix}.
    \]
Surface curvature can be approached more rigorously from the perspective of Riemannian geometry. The core concept behind Riemannian geometry are the eponymous manifolds: these are manifolds equipped with an positive definite inner product\footnote{In contrast to \cref{sec:lorentz_metric}, the positive definiteness of the inner product is essential for Riemannian geometry. When the inner product is not positive definite but nondegenerate, as the Lorentz product, the manifold is called \emph{pseudo-Riemannian}.} on their tangent space, hence providing a \emph{metric (tensor)} that allows to determine lengths, angles and curvature. The metric on a parametric surface \(\vec{r}(u, v)\) can be written in terms of the so-called \emph{first fundamental form} I, which is defined as the inner product of two tangent vectors to the surface  and is characterised by coefficients \(E\), \(F\) and \(G\).
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        E &= \vec{r}_u \cdot \vec{r}_u \\
        F &= \vec{r}_u \cdot \vec{r}_v \\
        G &= \vec{r}_v \cdot \vec{r}_v \\
        \text{with }  \vec{r}_u = & \pdv{\vec{r}}{u},\ \vec{r}_v = \pdv{\vec{r}}{v}.
    \end{split}
    \label{eq:first_fform}
\end{equation}
The components of the metric tensor \(\mathtens{g}\) then coincide with the components of the first fundamental form: \(g_{11} = E\), \(g_{12} = g_{21}= F\) and \(g_{22} = G\). Therefore, the first fundamental form determines the length of curves lying in the surface.

In contrast, the \emph{second fundamental form} II provides information on the curvature or shape of the embedded surface, more specifically the rate of change of the tangent planes in any direction. Again, it is characterised by three coefficients \(e\), \(f\) and \(g\) like so 
\[ e\dd{u}^2 + 2f\dd{u}\dd{v} + g\dd{v}^2. \]
The coefficients of the second fundamental form can be computed using the surface unit normal vector 
\begin{equation}
    \vec{n} =  \frac{\vec{r}_u \cross \vec{r}_v}{\norm{\vec{r}_u \cross \vec{r}_v}},
    \label{eq:unit_normal}
\end{equation}
the coefficients are then given by
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        e &= \vec{r}_{uu} \cdot \vec{n}\\
        f &= \vec{r}_{uv} \cdot \vec{n}\\
        g &= \vec{r}_{vv} \cdot \vec{n}\\
        \text{with }\ & \vec{r}_{uu} = \pdv[2]{\vec{r}}{u}\ \text{ etc.}
    \end{split}
    \label{eq:second_fform}
\end{equation}
Finally, the first and second fundamental form can then be used to determine the Gaussian curvature of the parametric surface: \cite{ONeill2006}
\begin{equation}
    k = \frac{\det(\mathrm{II})}{\det(\mathrm{I})} = \frac{eg - f^2}{EG - F^2}.
    \label{eq:gaussian_curv}
\end{equation}

To summarize, the connection between hyperbolic geometry and Gaussian curvature is concisely stated again below.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Hyperbolic geometry is the geometry with an alternative parallel axiom, where there are always at least two parallel lines for a given line through a point.
    \item The former fact is equivalent to stating that the angular excess \(\mathcal{E}\) is characterised by the negative constant \(k\) (constant over the entire hyperbolic plane).
    \item The Gauss-Bonnet theorem states that the constant \(k\) is given by the Gaussian curvature.
\end{enumerate}
Therefore, in order to represent hyperbolic geometry, one whishes to find a surface that exhibits constant negative Gaussian curvature. Some candidates exist for this criterion, the simplest of which is the so-called \emph{pseudosphere}.

\subsection{The pseudosphere}
Pseudospherical surfaces are surfaces of constant negative curvature, in that sense exhibiting a certain duality to a sphere which is a surface of constant positive curvature. The most notable example is the \emph{pseudosphere}; which is the surface of revolution of a tractrix --- another name for the pseudosphere is a \emph{tractricoid}. A tractrix is a curve defined by the property that the segment of the tangent from the point to the axis has constant length \(p\). \Cref{fig:tractrix} shows an example of such a curve. A parametric representation of the tractrix \(\gamma\) is given by 
\begin{equation} 
        \gamma: u \mapsto \qty(p\sech(u),\ p(u - \tanh(u))) \quad u \in \real^+
    \label{eq:tractrix}
\end{equation}
The a parameterization of the pseudosphere in terms of \(u\) and \(v\) is then easily obtained by taking the surface of revolution along the second axis
\begin{equation}
    \vec{r}(u, v) = 
    \mqty(
        p\sech(u)\cos(v)\\
        p\sech(u)\sin(v)\\
        p\qty(u - \tanh(u))) 
    \quad u \in \real^+,\ v \in [0, 2\pic).
    \label{eq:pseudosphere}
\end{equation}
A pseudosphere is visualized by \cref{fig:pseudosphere}; the mesh on the surface are isoparametric curves for \(u\) and \(v\).

\subsubsection{Curvature of the pseudosphere}
As explained in \cref{ssec:curvature}, the Gaussian curvature of a parametric surface may be calculated using the first and second fundamental form. It was already alluded that the pseudosphere has a constant negative Gaussian curvature, which will be formally shown in this section. 
Let the pseudosphere be parameterized as \cref{eq:pseudosphere}. Then, by virtue of \cref{eq:first_fform}, the coefficients of the first fundamental form \(E\), \(F\) and \(G\) are
\[
    \begin{split}
        E & = p^4\tanh[2](u) \\
        F & = 0 \\
        G & = p^4\sech[2](u) \\
    \end{split}
\]
From \cref{eq:unit_normal}, the unit normal vector is
\[
    \vec{n} 
    = \mqty(
        -\cos(v)\tanh[-1](u) \\
        -\sin(v)\tanh(u)\\
        -\cosh[-1](u)\\
    )
\]
and, consequently, the coefficients of the second fundamental form are
\begin{equation*}
    \begin{split}
        e &= -p\sech(u)\tanh(u)\\
        f &= 0\\
        g &= p\sech(u)\tanh(u)\\
    \end{split}
\end{equation*}
using \cref{eq:second_fform}. 
The Gaussian curvature can then be computed to be \cite{ONeill2006}
\begin{equation}
    k = \frac{\det(\mathrm{II})}{\det(\mathrm{I})} = \frac{eg - f^2}{EG - F^2} 
    = \frac{-p^2\sech[2](u)\tanh[2](u)}{p^4\sech[2](u)\tanh[2](u)} = -\frac{1}{p^2}.
\end{equation}
As such, the pseudosphere is shown to have a constant negative curvature everywhere but on the rim (where differentiability is lost).

Because the pseudosphere has constant negative curvature, it shares many properties of the hyperbolic plane. For example, the angular excess equation \cref{eq:angular_excess} holds on the pseudosphere \cite{Needham1997}. But, unlike a sphere can serve as a `globe' for spherical geometry, the pseudosphere cannot be used as a representative for the entire hyperbolic plane. First of all, they are not homeomorphic (the pseudosphere is homeomorphic to a cylinder, which has a different fundamental group than the hyperbolic plane\footnote{Intuitively, one can see this as the number of different ways it is possible to draw loops on the surface which are distinct up to a homotopy. On the pseudosphere and the cylinder, loops can `wrap' around the vertical axis any integer number of times, while on the (hyperbolic) plane all loops are homotopic \cite{Lee2000}.}). Secondly, the pseudosphere has a `rim' at the bottom which prevents any line segment from extending further downwards --- naturally, no such thing exists in the hyperbolic plane. As such, the pseudosphere can only serve as a model for finite regions of the hyperbolic plane, but not in its entirety. In technical terms, this means that the pseudosphere is \emph{locally isometric} to the hyperbolic plane \cite{Ghys2010}. This is why one must resort to models of the hyperbolic plane, they will be discussed in the next section.

\section{Models of the hyperbolic plane}
The pseudosphere cannot serve as a model for the hyperbolic plane. In fact, a theorem attributed to David Hilbert shows that, \emph{in Euclidean three-space, there can be no complete smooth surface with the intrinsic geometry of the pseudosphere} \cite{Thurston1997}. This is the reason why there can only be models of the hyperbolic plane. Several have been devised in the past, and they will provide a lot more mileage than the pseudosphere alone. The most popular models will be discussed in the following sections: there is a natural way to map the pseudosphere and the Poincaré half plane, which will be discussed first. Then, via the so-called \emph{Cayley transformation}, the half plane can be mapped to the Poincaré disk, perhaps the most illustrous model of them all. Using the disk model, one can naturally arive at the Cayley-Klein disk and the hyperboloid model --- the latter will be the starting point in the financial analogy.

\subsection{Poincaré half plane}
It has been pointed out that there are essentially two incompatibility problems with the pseudosphere that prevent devise a mapping between it and the complete hyperbolic plane (also, Hilbert's theorem immediately shatters any aspiration to find one): first, it is homeomorphic to the cylinder and secondly, it has an edge. This section will describe a conformal mapping between the surface of the pseudosphere and a `half plane', which can serve as a global model for the hyperbolic plane. However, the theorem by Hilbert already hints at the fact that this plane will have some `weird' properties, more specifically, a different notion of distance. 

As described by \citet{Needham1997}, one can imagine the pseudosphere to be cut open along any tractrix; the resulting surface can then be `unfolded' in the horizontal direction as if it were a treasure map on a table. The edges that were cut can be extended towards infinity by recognizing the periodicity that exists naturally on the pseudosphere itself; a particle traveling horizontally would wrap once around the pseudosphere every distance of \(2\pic\) traveled. Consequently, the circles on the pseudosphere that arise for constant values of \(z\) will be mapped to horizontal lines in the half plane. Formally, this simply means that the horizontal axis of the half plane \(\tilde{x}\) is equal to the angle \(u\). It has already been mentioned that the mapping between the pseudosphere and the half plane is \emph{conformal}, i.e. it locally preserves angles. Therefore, since the tractrix lines are everywhere perpendicular on the pseudosphere to the circles for constant \(z\), they must map to vertical lines in order to maintain this orthogonality. A horizontal movement in the half plane \(\dd{\tilde{x}}\) therefore corresponds on the pseudosphere with a traveled distance of \( \dd{\tilde{s}} = \sech(v) = \sech(v)\dd{v}\), because of the radius of the circle at that particular height. Because the mapping is conformal, a movement along a tractrix \(\dd{\sigma}\) must be scaled by the same factor:
\[ \dd{\sigma} = \sech(u)\dd{y}. \]
Subsequently, the movement along the tractrix can be written in terms of \(u\) and \(v\) using the parameterization:
\[ \dd{\sigma} = \norm{\pdv{\vec{r}}{u}\dd{u}} = \sqrt{\dd{u}^2 - \sech[2](u)\dd{u}^2} \]
Combining this with the previous expression found for \(\dd{\sigma}\), one arrives at
\begin{equation} 
    \dd{y} = \sinh(u)\dd{u} \implies y = \cosh(u) + C.
    \label{eq:dy_halfplane}
\end{equation}
Thus, the conformality of the mapping imposes a restriction on the mapping for \(y\) up to a constant \(C\), which is usually taken to be 0 \cite{Needham1997}. Using this information, the metric of the Poincaré half plane can also easily be deduced by \emph{pushing forward}\footnote{It must be clearly noted that the term \emph{pushforward metric} is not at all in place, and its usage here would in fact be quite pathological. The reason is as follows: the relation sketched here is not even strictly a mapping, as any point on the pseudosphere maps to an infinite amount of points on the half plane. Beyond this problem of the unique images there is also the obvious fact that their is no preimage for the part of the half plane where \(y < 1\) (non-surjective). As such, it would definitely make more sense to define the Poincaré metric first and then define the \emph{pullback metric} on the pseudosphere. However, since the pseudosphere exists in the familiar Euclidean space, it is more natural to introduce the pseudosphere first \cite{Schuller2014}.}
 the Euclidean metric of the pseudosphere:
\begin{equation} 
    \dd{s} = \norm{\pdv{\vec{r}}{u}\dd{u} + \pdv{\vec{r}}{v}\dd{v}}
    = \sech(u)\sqrt{\sinh[2](u)\dd{u}^2 + \dd{v}^2} = \frac{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}{y}
    \label{eq:hp_metric}
\end{equation}
This metric is called the \emph{Poincaré metric}. \Cref{eq:dy_halfplane} already states that for \(u = 0\), i.e. the rim of the pseudosphere, maps to the horizontal line \(y = 1\). This suggests that the pseudosphere is covered by the region of the half plane for which \(y \geq 1\).


The Poincaré metric suggests that distances get larger and larger when travelling downwards in \(y\)-direction. At the line \(y=0\) they even become infinitely large! For someone living in the half plane, this line would never be reachable, as they would have to travel for an infinite amount of time. It is not part of the half plane itself, which is why it is called the \emph{horizon}; points on the horizon are named \emph{ideal points} \cite{Needham1997}.

Geodesics in the Poincaré half plane connecting two points are either straight vertical lines if the two points have the same \(x\)-coordinate. Otherwise, the geodesic is the arc defined by the portion of the circle going through each of the two points that also intersects the \(x\)-axis at a right angle \cite{Ramsay1995}. Apart from the horizon, two other peculiar curves exist in the half plane that will also show up in later models:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{horocycles}: circles tangent to the \(x\)-axis or horizontal lines,
    \item and \emph{hypercycles}: circular arcs that intersect the \(x\)-axis at non-right angles or straight lines that intersect the \(x\)-axis at a non-right angle. 
\end{itemize}

    \label{fig:pseudosphere_hp}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Poincaré disk}
The Poincaré disk arises naturally from the Poincaré half plane by virtue of the Cayley transform. When the Poincaré half plane is viewed `on top' of the complex plane, the Cayley transform is defined as [source?]
\begin{equation}
    D(z) = \frac{\ii z + 1}{z + \ii}\quad z \in \complex
    \label{eq:cayley_transform}
\end{equation}
which maps the entire half plane to the unit disk. Furthermore, 
\begin{itemize}
    \item the horizon coincides with the rim of the disk,
    \item the points \(\pm1\) are invariant,
    \item and \(\ii\) maps to the origin.
\end{itemize}
As will become clear later, \cref{eq:cayley_transform} belongs to the class of Möbius transforms, which means that it also must be conformal. Therefore, angles on the pseudosphere, half plane and disk will all look alike. Since the horizon containing the ideal points is now the rim of the unit disk, it makes sense that the pullback metric based on \cref{eq:hp_metric} will have the $y$ replaced by the distance from the rim of the unit disk, which is $1 - x^2 - y^2$. Indeed, the halfplane metric can be written as in terms of the complex variable $z$, using the mapping \cref{eq:cayley_transform} the metric in the disk turns out to be \cite{Needham1997}
\[
    \dd{s} = \frac{\abs{\dd{z}}}{\imaginary(z)} = \frac{2\abs{\dd{\tilde{z}}}}{1 - \abs{z}^2} \qquad \text{with }\ \tilde{z} = D(z).
\]
In \(x-y\) coordinates, this metric is
\begin{equation}
    \dd{s} = \frac{2\sqrt{\dd{x}^2 + \dd{y}^2}}{1 - x^2 - y^2}.
\end{equation}
It has been pointed out that the Cayley transform is a member of a larger class called Möbius transforms, which will be elaborated upon in \cref{sec:mobius}. Apart from being conformal, Möbius transforms also preserve circles (i.e. the result of a a Möbius transform applied to a circle will again be a circle). The geodesics in the half plane have the either the shape of straight lines extending from the horizontal axis, or circles that are cross the horizontal axis at a right angle. Consequently, it is straightforward to deduce that the geodesics in the Poincaré disk are also circles that `start' orthogonally to the rim of the unit disk. Additionally, all diameters of the Poincaré disk are geodesics as well: they can be interpreted as circles with infinite radius that are obviously also orthogonal to the rim of the disk.
