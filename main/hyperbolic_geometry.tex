\section{Basic facts}
Hyperbolic geometry, sometimes called Lobachevskian geometry\footnote{After the Russian mathematician Nikolai Lobachevsky (1832) who first published about this subject \cite{Needham1997}.} is the geometry on the hyperbolic plane. This type of geometry is called non-Euclidean, because it does not satisfy all of Euclid's axioms that form the building blocks of traditional  geometry. More specifically, the fifth axiom, called the parallel axiom, states that \cite{Needham1997}
\begin{quote}
    Through any point \(p\) not on the line \(L\) there exists precisely one line \(L'\) that does not meet \(L\).
\end{quote}
Logic dictates that if this axiom is not true, two possible alternatives arise. Given again the point \(p\) and the line \(L\), 
\begin{itemize}
    \item there exists \emph{no} line through \(p\) that does not meet \(L\), or
    \item there exist \emph{at least two} lines through \(p\) that do not meet \(L\).
\end{itemize}
The first statement corresponds to what is called \emph{spherical geometry}, while the latter is the defining axiom for \emph{hyperbolic geometry}. It does not take too much imagination to realize that the parallel axiom is equivalent to another basic fact in Euclidean geometry: the sum of the angles of a triangle is equal to \(\pi\). As such, for both types of non-Euclidean geometry this will not be the case; let \(\mathcal{E}(T)\) denote the \emph{angular excess} of a triangle \(T\) in a certain geometry.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Naturally, for Euclidean geometry \(\mathcal{E}(T) = 0\),
    \item in spherical geometry, \(\mathcal{E}(T) > 0\),
    \item in hyperbolic geometry, \(\mathcal{E}(T) < 0\).
\end{itemize}
It may come as a surprise that the angular excess can be related to the size of the triangle (more specifically, its area) like so \cite{Needham1997}
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{E}(T) = k\mathcal{A}(T)
    \label{eq:angular_excess} 
\end{equation}
where \(k = 0\) for Euclidean geometry, \(k < 0\) for hyperbolic geometry and \(k > 0\) for spherical geometry. This hints at the fact that spherical geometry and hyperbolic geometry are somehow `larger' classes of geometry than Euclidean geometry, since they exist for a whole range of values for \(k\), be it positive or negative. There is indeed a `different' geometry for every value of \(k\), and only one of those values corresponds to the traditional concept of Euclidean geometry that most people are familiar with. Another consequence of \cref{eq:angular_excess} is that similar triangles cannot exist in non-Euclidean geometry; since apart from the trivial case where the triangles are also congruent, they must differ in area, which yields a different angular excess. The value of \(k\) is, as it turns out, equal to the \emph{Gaussian curvature} of the surface: a negatively curved surface has an angular deficiency while a positively curved surface has an angular excess; only for surface with zero curvature the sum of the angles of a triangle will be precisely equal to \(\pic\).

\subsection{Surface curvature}
Perhaps one of the most remarkable results attributed to Carl Friedrich Gauss is his \emph{Theorema Egregium} about the (Gaussian) curvature of surfaces. The theorem states that curvature is an \emph{intrinsic} property, which means that it remains preserved when the surface is transformed by `bending without stretching'. Curvature can be positive, negative or zero. Positively curved surfaces `bend away' from their tangent plane in any direction (local convexity) and negatively curved surfaces intersect their tangent plane like a saddle. For surfaces with zero curvature, there is always at least one straight line that lies in the tangent plane; examples are a cylinder (always one straight line) and a plane (straight lines in two directions). If a coordinate system is defined such that the point at issue is at the origin and the tangent plane to the surface described by \(f(x, y)\) coincides with the horizontal, the Gaussian curvature can be computed by means of the determinant of the Hessian \cite{Thurston1997, ONeill2006}
    \[ 
        k = \det \begin{pmatrix}
                \pdv[2]{f}{x} & \pdv{f}{x}{y}\\[6pt]
                \pdv{f}{y}{x} & \pdv[2]{f}{x}
        \end{pmatrix}.
    \]
Surface curvature can be approached more rigorously from the perspective of Riemannian geometry. The core concept behind Riemannian geometry are the eponymous manifolds: these are manifolds equipped with an positive definite inner product\footnote{In contrast to \cref{sec:lorentz_metric}, the positive definiteness of the inner product is essential for Riemannian geometry. When the inner product is not positive definite but nondegenerate, as the Lorentz product, the manifold is called \emph{pseudo-Riemannian}.} on their tangent space, hence providing a \emph{metric (tensor)} that allows to determine lengths, angles and curvature. The Gaussian curvature \(k\) is a function such that the second structural equation
    \[
        \dd{\omega_{12}} = -k \theta_1 \wedge \theta_2
    \]
holds. Here, 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(\omega_{ij}\) is the connection form, a one-form, \(
        \omega_{ij} = - \omega_{ji}\)
        \[ 
            \omega_{ij}(\vb{v}) = \grad_v E_i \cdot E_j (\vb{p})
        \]
    \item \(\theta_i\) are dual one-forms
        \[ 
            \theta_i(\vb{v}) = \vb{v}\cdot E_i(\vb{p}) 
        \]
        \(\theta_i\) give the dual basis of \(E_i\).
\end{itemize}
Surfaces with constant curvature have a geometry satisfying the important the vital properties of homogeneity (transivity of the group of symmetries) and isotropy (all directions are equivalent) \cite{Thurston1997}. An example of a surface with constant positive curvature is a simple sphere, which has curvature \(1/R^2\) at every point. For constant negative curvature, the prime candidate is a bit more exotic: the pseudosphere.

\subsection{The pseudosphere}
Pseudospherical surfaces are surfaces of constant negative curvature, in that sense exhibiting a certain duality to a sphere which is a surface of constant positive curvature. The most notable example is the \emph{pseudosphere}; which is the surface of revolution of a tractrix --- another name for the pseudosphere is a \emph{tractricoid}. A tractrix is a curve defined by the property that the segment of the tangent from the point to the axis has constant length \(R\). It can be parameterized by the pair

\towrite{derivation tractrix}

    \[ 
        \qty(R(t - \tanh(t)),\ R\sech(t)) \quad t \in \real^+.
    \]
It can be shown that this surface has a constant curvature of \(1/R^2\)

    \end{subfigure}

\end{figure}
Because the pseudosphere has constant negative curvature, it shares some resemblance to the hyperbolic plane (i.e. the plane in which hyperbolic geometry takes place). For example, the angular excess equation \cref{eq:angular_excess} holds on the pseudosphere \cite{Needham1997}. However, it is not surprising that it is not \emph{equivalent} to the hyperbolic plane: they are not homeomorphic (the pseudosphere is homeomorphic to a cylinder, which has a different fundamental group than the hyperbolic plane\footnote{Intuitively, one can see this as the number of different ways it is possible to draw loops on the surface which are distinct up to a homotopy. On the pseudosphere and the cylinder, loops can `wrap' around the vertical axis any integer number of times, while on the (hyperbolic) plane all loops are homotopic \cite{Lee2000}.}). Secondly, the pseudosphere has a `rim' at the bottom which prevents any line segment from extending further downwards --- naturally, no such thing exists in the hyperbolic plane. As such, the pseudosphere can only serve as a model for finite regions of the hyperbolic plane, but not in its entirety. In technical terms, this means that the pseudosphere is \emph{locally isometric} to the hyperbolic plane \cite{Ghys2010}.

\subsubsection{Curvature of the pseudosphere}
The Gaussian curvature of the pseudosphere may be calculated using the first and second fundamental form. Let the pseudosphere be parameterized as follows: 
    \[ 
        \vb{r}(u, v) = \mqty(\sech(u)\cos(v)\\
                      \sech(u)\sin(v)\\
                  u - \tanh(u))
    \]
Then the coefficients of the first fundamental form \(E\), \(F\) and \(G\) are
    \[
        \begin{split}
            E &= \vb{r}_u \cdot \vb{r}_u = \tanh[2](u) \\
            F &= \vb{r}_u \cdot \vb{r}_v = 0 \\
            G &= \vb{r}_v \cdot \vb{r}_v = \sech[2]](u) \\
            \text{with } & \vb{r}_u = \pdv{\vb{r}}{u},\ \vb{r}_v = \pdv{\vb{r}}{v}.
        \end{split}
    \]
For the coefficients of the second fundamental form, one needs an expression for the unit normal vector to the surface:
    \[
        \vb{n} =  \frac{\vb{r}_u \cross \vb{r}_v}{\norm{\vb{r}_u \cross \vb{r}_v}} 
        = \mqty(-\cos(v)\tanh[-1](u) \\
                -\sin(v)\tanh(u)\\
                -\cosh[-1](u)\\
                )
    \]
\begin{equation*}
    \begin{split}
        e &= \vb{r}_{uu} \cdot \vb{n} = -\sech(u)\tanh(u)\\
        f &= \vb{r}_{uv} \cdot \vb{n} = 0\\
        g &= \vb{r}_{vv} \cdot \vb{n} = \sech(u)\tanh(u)\\
        \text{with }\ & \vb{r}_{uu} = \pdv[2]{\vb{r}}{u}\ \text{ etc.}
    \end{split}
\end{equation*}
The Gaussian curvature can then be computed to be \cite{ONeill2006}
\begin{equation}
    k = \frac{\det(\mathrm{II})}{\det(\mathrm{I})} = \frac{eg - f^2}{EG - F^2} = \frac{-\sech[2](u)\tanh[2](u)}{\sech[2](u)\tanh[2](u)} = -1 \qquad u > 0.
\end{equation}
As such, the pseudosphere is shown to have a constant negative curvature everywhere but on the rim (where differentiability is lost).

\section{Models of the hyperbolic plane}
The pseudosphere cannot serve as a model for the hyperbolic plane. In fact, a theorem attributed to David Hilbert shows that, \emph{in Euclidean three-space, there can be no complete smooth surface with the intrinsic geometry of the pseudosphere}. This is the reason why there can only be `models' of the hyperbolic plane. Several have been devised in the past, and they will provide a lot more mileage than the pseudosphere alone. The most popular models will be discussed in the following sections: there is a natural way to map the pseudosphere and the Poincaré half plane, which will be discussed first. Then, via the so-called \emph{Cayley transformation}, the half plane can be mapped to the Poincaré disk, perhaps the most illustrous model of them all. Using the disk model, one can naturally arive at the Cayley-Klein disk and the hyperboloid model --- the latter will be the starting point in the financial analogy.

\subsection{Poincaré half plane}
It has been pointed out that there are essentially two incompatibility problems with the pseudosphere that prevent devise a mapping between it and the complete hyperbolic plane (also, Hilbert's theorem immediately shatters any aspiration to find one): first, it is homeomorphic to the cylinder and secondly, it has an edge. This section will describe a conformal mapping between the surface of the pseudosphere and a `half plane', which can serve as a global model for the hyperbolic plane. However, the theorem by Hilbert already hints at the fact that this plane will have some `weird' properties, more specifically, a different notion of distance. 

As described by \citet{Needham1997}, one can imagine the pseudosphere to be cut open along any tractrix; the resulting surface can then be `unfolded' in the horizontal direction as if it were a treasure map on a table. The edges that were cut can be extended towards infinity by recognizing the periodicity that exists naturally on the pseudosphere itself; a particle traveling horizontally would wrap once around the pseudosphere every distance of \(2\pic\) traveled. Consequently, the circles on the pseudosphere that arise for constant values of \(z\) will be mapped to horizontal lines in the half plane. Formally, this simply means that the horizontal axis of the half plane \(\tilde{x}\) is equal to the angle \(u\). It has already been mentioned that the mapping between the pseudosphere and the half plane is \emph{conformal}, i.e. it preserves locally angles. Therefore, since the tractrix lines are everywhere perpendicular on the pseudosphere to the circles for constant \(z\), they must map to vertical lines in order to maintain this orthogonality. A horizontal movement in the half plane \(\dd{\tilde{x}}\) therefore corresponds on the pseudosphere with a traveled distance of \(\sech(v)\dd{\tilde{x}} = \sech(v)\dd{v}\), because of the radius of the circle at that particular height. Because the map is conformal, the map must be identical in any direction:
